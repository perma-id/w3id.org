Description:

The FAIR Funding Framework (FAIR/FF) creates reusable information on workflows in research practice: (1) the grant procedure, (2) the research data life cycle, and (3) the research domain. The FFF supports research groups and funders to produce rich, integrated information (metadata) of data (and other resources) that are used in research projects and to make them available for future use.
