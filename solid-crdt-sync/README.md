# /solid-crdt-sync/

Permanent identifiers for the Solid CRDT Sync framework vocabulary and mapping files.

[https://w3id.org/solid-crdt-sync/vocab/](https://w3id.org/solid-crdt-sync/vocab/) redirects to the vocabulary files at [https://kkalass.github.io/solid_crdt_sync/vocab/](https://kkalass.github.io/solid_crdt_sync/vocab/).

[https://w3id.org/solid-crdt-sync/mappings/](https://w3id.org/solid-crdt-sync/mappings/) redirects to the mapping files at [https://kkalass.github.io/solid_crdt_sync/mappings/](https://kkalass.github.io/solid_crdt_sync/mappings/).

The Solid CRDT Sync framework enables synchronization of RDF data to Solid Pods using CRDT (Conflict-free Replicated Data Types) for local-first, interoperable applications. These permanent identifiers provide stable IRIs for the framework's vocabularies (`crdt:`, `algo:`, `sync:`, `idx:`, `mc:`) and merge contract mappings.
