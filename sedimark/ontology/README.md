# SEDIMARK Marketplace Ontology  

The Marketplace Information Model is an RDFS/OWL-ontology covering the fundamental concepts of SEDIMARK needed for the registration of participants and the discovery and exchange of offerings and assets. This model establishes a common framework to ensure interoperability within a SEDIMARK-based Marketplace, to enable participants to discover and exchange assets in the form of offerings.
This common ontology is meant to serve as a shared language, fostering seamless communication and interoperability among the users of SEDIMARK. Therefore, the use of this information model is enforced for any participant or component that wants to join the Marketplace based on SEDIMARK guidelines. The main goal of this model is to ease the search and discovery of Participants and their offers, describing accurately their information.
