# /ssv/
This [W3ID](https://w3id.org) provides a persistent URI namespace for data produced by [Signature Sound Vienna](https://iwk.mdw.ac.at/signature-sound-vienna) and associated projects.

## Uses

This namespace is used solely for data related to the **Signature Sound Vienna** project, as set out in [Weigl et al (2022)](https://doi.org/10.1145/3543882.3543892) and [Weigl et al (2023)](https://doi.org/10.1145/3625135.3625144).

The path on its own, or with the suffix `/latest`, will always point to the latest version of the dataset. Specific versions can be specified in the path (e.g., `https://w3id.org/ssv/0.9/`).

Content negotiation is used to choose a suitable RDF serialisation format.
