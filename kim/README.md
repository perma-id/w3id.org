# KIM

The Kompentenzzentrum Interoperable Metadaten (Interoperable Metadata Competence Center, KIM) is an information and communication platform for German-speaking metadata pracitioners and developers on the following topics:

- cross-application integration of metadata
- national and international metadata standards
- connection of the German-speaking community to the international metadata community

KIM promotes and supports through workshops and committee work the development of metadata standards, the interoperable design of formats, and thus the optimal use of metadata in digital information environments.

The w3id.org URIs are used as permanent URLs for standards (specifications of application profiles, schemas etc.).
