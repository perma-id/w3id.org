## Permanent URIs for the OntoForge vocabularies

This project hosts the redirections for the OntoForge vocabularues, particularly for the the WeDoWind ontology community.

At OntoForge, we bring together industry professionals and academics dedicated to developing information models in engineering and technology. 
There, ideas and use cases for information models emerge as community members form expert groups, while still interacting and maintaining close connections with other communities.


### Our Mission
 - Unify Knowledge: Develop comprehensive ontologies that standardize concepts and terminology in engineering and technology domains.

 - Promote Collaboration: Foster a global community where members can contribute, share, and refine ontological resources.

 - Advance Innovation: Enhance data interoperability and communication to accelerate technological advancements.
