# Event Venue Registry

This [W3ID](https://w3id.org) provides persistent URLs for entities and
artifacts in the
[Qualification Ontology](https://github.com/event-venue-registry/evr), an
ontology of qualifications, distinctions, and certifications that uses the
Phenotype And Trait Ontology term quality (PATO:0000001) as a root term.

## Vocabulary

Currently, the Qualification Ontology auto-generates a site on GitHub.

The identifier (`0000001`) representing the root term _qualification_ site here:
https://cthoyt.github.io/qualo/0000001.

The `.htaccess` file in this directory enables the construction of a PURL for
this entity like https://w3id.org/qualo/id/0000001.

## Ontology Artifacts

There are OWL and OBO ontology artifacts generated that can be accessed at:

- https://w3id.org/qualo/qualo.owl
- https://w3id.org/qualo/qualo.obo
- https://w3id.org/qualo/qualo.ofn
