# RiverBench RDF benchmark suite
[RiverBench](https://github.com/RiverBench) is a suite of curated and well-described datasets for benchmarking RDF systems, especially in streaming applications.

## Contents
The .htaccess file is rather long, as it needs to serve various metadata for datasets, benchmark profiles, and schemas (ontologies). It also handles redirects to the actual data files and documentation pages.

The docs are hosted on GitHub Pages, and the data and metadata files are stored as releases on GitHub.
