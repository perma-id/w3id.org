# SemSur
SemSur, the Semantic Survey Ontology, is a core ontology for describing individual research problems, approaches, implementations and evaluations in a structured, comparable way.
We describe its structure and contents, which captures detailed terminological knowledge about survey articles, e.g., evaluation method, hypothesis, benchmark, and experiment.
