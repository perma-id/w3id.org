# /simulation/
This [W3ID](https://w3id.org) provides a persistent URI namespace for the simulation ontology and its knowledge graph of symbolism.

## Uses
This namespace is broken down into different different parts:
* [https://w3id.org/simulation/docs/](https://w3id.org/simulation/docs/) leads to a [widoco](https://github.com/dgarijo/Widoco) visualization of the ontology.
* [https://w3id.org/simulation/ontology/](https://w3id.org/simulation/ontology/) leads to a raw owl file of the ontology (useful for imports)
* [https://w3id.org/simulation/data/](https://w3id.org/simulation/data/) leads to HyperReal, a knowledge graph of cultural symbols that follows the ontology pattern serialized in [turtle](https://www.w3.org/TR/turtle/) 
* [https://w3id.org/simulation/development/](https://w3id.org/simulation/development/) leads to a github repository that contains the development documentation of the ontology.
* [https://w3id.org/simulation/code/](https://w3id.org/simulation/code/) leads to a github repository that contains the code of the conversion algorithms used in the Simulation Ontology's based knowledge graph.
* https://w3id.org/simulation/query/ will lead to a future queryable SPARQL portal of the knowledge graph. (**not active yet**)
