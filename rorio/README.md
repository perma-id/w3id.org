# ROR in OWL

This [W3ID](https://w3id.org/) provides a persistent URI namespace for [Research Organization Registry (ROR)](https://ror.org) records in OWL resources.

## Uses

ROR in OWL is an ontology that wraps ROR identifiers as named individuals so they can be more easily included in other ontologies (e.g., OBO Ontologies) and empower the [Protégé](https://protege.stanford.edu/) ontology editor to show rich label information for `dc:contributor` annotations.
