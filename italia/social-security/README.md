Repository (italia/social-security) for redirecting to ontologies and open data of INPS (the National Institute for Social Security)  
===================

We intend to use **w3id.org/italia/social-security** for national persistent URIs for social security information of the public sector.

We initially plan to create:
+ `w3id.org/italia/social-security/onto` for all the ontologies of the network mentioned above
+ `w3id.org/italia/social-security/controlled-vocabulary` for all the controlled vocabularies
+ `w3id.org/italia/social-security/data` for all the other types of data


Some redirect rules will be to the [github repository of INPS](https://github.com/INPS-it/NDC) we are using as semantic assets repo, open to all.
