Repository (italia/work-accident) for redirecting to ontologies and open data of INAIL (the National Institute for Insurance against Accidents at Work)  
===================

We intend to use **w3id.org/italia/work-accident** for national persistent URIs for work accident information of the public sector.

We initially plan to create:
+ `w3id.org/italia/work-accident/onto` for all the ontologies of the network mentioned above
+ `w3id.org/italia/work-accident/controlled-vocabulary` for all the controlled vocabularies
+ `w3id.org/italia/work-accident/data` for all the other types of data


Some redirect rules will be to the [github repository of INAIL](https://github.com/InailUfficio5/inail-ndc) we are using as semantic assets repo, open to all.
