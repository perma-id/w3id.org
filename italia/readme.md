Persistent URIs for ontologies and controlled vocabularies of the Italian Public Sector
===================

We intend to use w3id.org in order to obtain persistent URIs for the [Italian network of ontologies and controlled vocabularies for the Public Administrations](https://github.com/italia/daf-ontologie-vocabolari-controllati). The network is also currently maintained in collaboration with the Institute of Cognitive Sciences and Technologies (Semantic Technologies Laboratory - STLab) of the Italian National Research Council (ISTC-CNR).
The network is used in the context of the Italian public sector and, in particolar, it is the principal content of the so-called NDC - National Data Catalogue whose implementation is currently deployed under the form of the Italian [National Catalogue of Semantic Assets named schema.gov.it](https://schema.gov.it).
We also intend to use w3id.org/italia for national persistent URIs of the public sector. Therefore, we will include rules for specific public sector domains owned by single Italian Public Administrations that want to publish ontologies and data using w3id.org/italia namespace in their persistent URIs.

We define: 
+ w3id.org/italia/onto for all the ontologies of the network mentioned above;
+ w3id.org/italia/controlled-vocabulary for all the controlled vocabularies;
+ w3id.org/italia/data for the linked open data that is produced in the above context
