Repository for redirecting to ontologies and controlled vocabularies of the Italian Public Administrations.
===================

We intend to use w3id.org in order to obtain persistent URIs for the [Italian network of ontologies and controlled vocabularies (OntoPiA) for the Public Administrations](https://github.com/italia/daf-ontologie-vocabolari-controllati). The network is developed also in collaboration with the Institute of Cognitive Sciences and Technologies (Semantic Technologies Laboratory - STLab) of the Italian National Research Council (CNR).
OntoPiA is used in the context of the Italian [Data and Analytics Framework (DAF)](http://daf-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), the big data infrastructure that Italy is currently constructing under the supervision of the Italian Digital Transformation Team and the Italian Digital Agency of the Presidency of the Council of Ministers.

We are planning to create: 
+ w3id.org/italia/onto for all the ontologies of the network mentioned above;
+ w3id.org/italia/controlled-vocabulary for all the controlled vocabularies;
+ w3id.org/italia/metadata for all metadata defined for annotating data, ontologies and vocabularies for the Italian Public Administration.
 
The initial redirect will be to the github repository we are using as working repo, open to all communities. When DAF will be in production in the upcoming months, it is likely that we will change the redirect to the official domain.
Afterwards, when linked (open) data will be produced and published, we are also planning to create a specific directory italia/data.
