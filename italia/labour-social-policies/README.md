Repository (italia/labour-social-policies) for redirecting to ontologies and open data of MLPS (the Ministry of Labour and Social Policies)  
===================

We intend to use **w3id.org/italia/labour-social-policies** for national persistent URIs for labour social policies.

We initially plan to create:
+ `w3id.org/italia/labour-social-policies/onto` for all the ontologies of the network mentioned above
+ `w3id.org/italia/labour-social-policies/controlled-vocabulary` for all the controlled vocabularies
+ `w3id.org/italia/labour-social-policies/data` for all the other types of data


Some redirect rules will be to the [github repository of MLPS DG Innovazione – Divisione III](https://github.com/MlpsDgInnovazioneDivisioneIII/mlps-ndc) we are using as semantic assets repo, open to all.
