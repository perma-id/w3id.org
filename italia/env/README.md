Repository (italia/env) for redirecting to ontologies and data of the Linked ISPRA system (the Linked Open Data and the network of ontologies of the Italian Institute for Environmental Protection and Research, ISPRA)
===================

We intend to use w3id.org to provide persistent URIs for the network of ontologies and data we are developing in the context of the [Linked ISPRA](https://dati.isprambiente.it) system. The network is developed by ISPRA (The Italian Institute for Environmental Protection and Research, ISPRA â€” Istituto Superiore per la Protezione e la Ricerca Ambientale). We intend to use **w3id.org/italia/env** for national persistent URIs for environmental information of the public sector.

We initially plan to create:
+ `w3id.org/italia/env/onto` for all the ontologies of the network mentioned above
+ `w3id.org/italia/env/vocab` for all the controlled vocabularies
+ `w3id.org/italia/env/ld` for all the other types of data


Some redirect rules will be to the [github repository of ISPRA](https://github.com/isprambiente/dati-semantic) we are using as semantic assets repo, open to all; others to the ISPRA server.
