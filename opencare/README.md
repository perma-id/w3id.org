# OpenCare: Open healthCare ontology   

Open healthCare Ontology is an integrated metadata vocabulary developed as an ontological data model, to facilitate the effective reasoning of patient-specific electronic health record (EHR) data. The OpenCare model identifies the concepts and semantic types in the EHR data with the aim of enabling the representation of clinical data in a way that is accessible and usable by researchers and healthcare facility users. The development of OpenCare and its components is formalized using the Ontology Web Language (OWL). This ontology aims to enhance the accessibility and user-friendliness of EHR clinical data.
