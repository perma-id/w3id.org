# DICE research group

The DICE group at [Paderborn University](https://upb.de) is dedicated to research at the interfaces between humans, machines and data. This includes in particular the extraction, integration, querying and use of knowledge graphs in all forms. We currently focus on developing data-driven solutions to challenges such as question answering, explainable and responsible machine learning as well as safety. The results of our research have led to more than 25 international research awards. As a university research group, we support the upcoming generation of computer scientists through lectures, seminars and project groups on topics including knowledge graphs, information retrieval, natural language processing and Semantic Web technologies. We often have job vacancies for students and postgraduates and welcome applications. We are dedicated to open-source software and open publications and are always up to a good research challenge. Do not hesitate to contact us if you are interested in collaborating with us.
