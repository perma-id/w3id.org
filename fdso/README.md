# FDSO: Flood Disaster Support Ontology  

Flood Disaster Support Ontology (FDSO) provides an ontological data model to support urban flood disaster response. It can be used as a data model that can accommodate the various organizations and agents of different levels of the administrative agencies that are part of the flood disaster management process. It depicts their relationships and their activities specifically during an urban flood disaster response. The ontology also organizes the resources and the information about them that are possessed by different organizations and may be used by first responders to carry out the activities like rescue and relief.
