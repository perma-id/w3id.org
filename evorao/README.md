## EVORAO

This directory contains redirections for the EVORAO ontology namespace:  
ðŸ”— [https://w3id.org/evorao/](https://w3id.org/evorao/)

**EVORAO** (European Viral Outbreak Response Alliance Ontology) is developed as part of the [EVORA project](https://www.evora-project.eu/), a European initiative to support robust data stewardship and semantic interoperability in virology research. The ontology defines key concepts, properties, and metadata related to the collection, distribution, and use of pathogens, derived biological products, and associated services.

This `w3id.org` namespace provides **persistent, version-independent IRIs** for the ontology and its terms. It supports content negotiation to serve RDF serializations (e.g., Turtle, JSON-LD) and redirects to the Ontology Lookup Service (OLS) for human-readable interfaces.
