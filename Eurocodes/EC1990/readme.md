# ECO - Eurocode Core Ontology

<p> This repository contains the files of the ECO - Eurocode Core Ontology. </p>
<p> The Eurocode Core Ontology (ECO) provides a semantically structured representation of the European structural design standards known as the Eurocodes. These standards, currently written in natural language, pose challenges for automation and digital interoperability in the Architecture, Engineering, Construction, and Operations (AECO) sector. ECO addresses this gap by modeling the key regulatory concepts, terminologies, and dependencies found in Eurocode 0 (EN 1990) and supporting modules. Built on OWL and aligned with upper-level and domain-specific ontologies such as BFO, EMMO, PMDCo, BOT, and OMG, ECO enables automated reasoning, rule-based compliance checking, and seamless integration with BIM and FEM tools. It supports advanced use cases such as load combination inference, material classification, and spatially contextual verification of structural elements—laying the groundwork for next-generation ontology-based expert systems in structural engineering.</p>
