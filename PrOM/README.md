# PrOM: Provenance Ontology for Questionnaire Metadata

Provenance Ontology for Questionnaire Metadata (**PrOM**) is a domain-specific ontology developed to formally represent the provenance and evolution of metadata in longitudinal survey research. In large-scale studies, questionnaires frequently evolve across successive waves to accommodate emerging research priorities, revised methodological protocols, or technical refinements. Such modifications may vary in scope, ranging from minor textual revisions to extensive restructuring of questions or response categories. **PrOM** provides a structured, machine-readable, and interoperable framework to capture and document these evolutionary changes.
