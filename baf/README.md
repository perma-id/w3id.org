# Building Automation Functions (BAF)

This [W3ID](https://w3id.org) provides a persistent URI namespace for the BAF (Building Automation Functions) ontology.

## Uses

The BAF (Building Automation Functions) model is a catalogue of generic control functions usually implemented by automation engineers 
when designing and deploying BACS (Building Automation and Control Systems). It defines so called function blocks together with their 
parameters, inputs / outputs (I/O), and additional functions. They describe the functional building blocks that BACS systems implement 
to control and monitor HVAC systems (Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning).
