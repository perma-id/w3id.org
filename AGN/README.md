This initiative is supported by NCRIS and AuScope. The AGN is committed to producing and maintaining structured geochemical data schemas for a range of techniques and analytical instrumentation for use in the Earth Science community. These schemas also underpin the AusGeochem platfor, an AGN project which provides a FAIR community platform for storing, publishing, integrating and sharing geochemical data.
