# ClassRank
## Description
ClassRank is an unsupervised technique useful for discovering URIs representing abstract concepts (classes) in a knowledge graph, and to measure their relevance within the source. ClassRank is primarily based on notions of graph centrality according to the PageRank algorithm. ClassRank associates each found class with a score with the following equivalent meanings:

* Accumulated centrality (PageRank) score of its instances.
* Chance of reaching one of its instances while surfing the graph randomly.
