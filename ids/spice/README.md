**Name of the project:** [SPICE H2020](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/870811)

**Description:** The overall aim of the project is to foster diverse participation 
in the heritage domain through a process of ""citizen curation"". Citizens will 
be supported to: develop their own personal interpretations of cultural objects; 
work together to present their collective view of life through culture and heritage; 
and gain an appreciation of alternative cultural viewpoints.
Methods will be codesigned that can be used by citizen groups to produce personal 
interpretations of cultural objects and analyse and compare them against the 
interpretations of others. Tools will be developed for modelling users and groups 
and recommending content in a way that assists citizen groups in building a 
representation of themselves and appreciating variety within groups and similarity across 
groups to enhance social cohesion. A Linked Data infrastructure will support citizen 
curation using social media platforms in a way that gives heritage institutions control 
over rights protected digital assets and access to citizens responses to their collections. 
User experiences will be designed that enable inclusive participation in citizen curation 
activities across cultures and abilities. A series of citizen curation case studies with 
a diverse set of museums and citizen groups will demonstrate how the approach can promote 
inclusive participation and social cohesion in a variety of contexts.
The project brings together 13 partners from 7 countries. The consortium comprises: 
three SMEs from the visitor guide (GVAM), mobile game (PadaOne) and data mining 
(CELI) sectors; four heritage institutions (Design Museum Helsinki, Irish Museum 
of Modern Art, Gallery of Modern Art Turin, Hecht Museum); and seven research 
centres (Bologna, Aalto, Aalborg, OU, UCM, Turin, Haifa) with expertise in codesign, 
museology, HCI, Linked Data, narratology, ontologies, visualisation and user modelling.
