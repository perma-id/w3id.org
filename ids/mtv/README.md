# /mtv/
This [W3ID](https://w3id.org) provides an auxiliary persistent-identifier namespace, supported by the Maieutike Research Initiative.

## Uses
This namespace is used by the Maieutike Free Knowledge Panel, as an auxiliary permalink system for the projects freely and voluntarily supported by the Panel.
The auxiliary permalink system is meant as a complement to the array-based semantics (Semantic Array Programming) &mdash; implemented thanks to the independent [Mastrave project](http://mastrave.org/) &mdash; when providing a long-lasting reference to documents, files, web pages, or other digital objects that are accessible over the Internet. This namespace is provided "as is" in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
