# Learning and Employment Records

This draft specification is being developed in the public domain and will be offered for recognition as a standard by relevant standards organizations concerned with Learner Record interoperability.

The term “learner” in the context of the T3 Innovation Network (T3 Network https://www.uschamberfoundation.org/t3-innovation) includes students, workers, military personnel, and others as today’s talent marketplace is dependent on lifelong learning—whereas an individual takes on different roles at different organizations (sometimes simultaneously) over the course of their life. This work is being developed within the T3 Network with assistance from project teams to leverage existing Learner Record standards, not replace them. It will be offered for adoption by various standards organizations. It will also inform a guide to interoperable Learning and Employment Records proposed by an active IEEE study group.
