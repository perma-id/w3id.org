# More information about this entity itself
# -------------------
# It is not possible to retrieve the identifier
# https://w3id.org/related-to/doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5494490
# (i.e. without trailing slash) because of the structure of the w3id.org configuration.
# We therefore provide a separate endpoint for information about this entity itself:
#
# COMMENT: ^$ is matching https://w3id.org/related-to/doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5494490/ ,
#          i.e. the final part after the slash is matched by the RewriteRule
#
RewriteRule ^$       https://w3id.org/related-to/doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5494490/meta [R=301,L,QSA]
RewriteRule ^meta$   https://github.com/perma-id/w3id.org/blob/master/related-to/doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5494490/README.md [R=303,L,QSA]


# Catch all trailing-slash URLs
# -------------------
# Catch the trailing-slash variation of all URLs in this namespace, and remove the slash;
# do this because the slashed versions shall have no meaning
#
# COMMENT: %{REQUEST_URI} is of the form "/related-to/doi.org/..."
#
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} /(.*)/$
RewriteRule ^ /%1 [R=301,L]


# Active Identifiers
# ------------------
# This block contains active identifier redirects:
#
RewriteRule ^files$                      https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5494490 [R=303,L,QSA]

# Obsolete Identifiers
# --------------------
# Obsolete Identifiers have been minted once, and are gone now.
# Best-practice handling to communicate this is not specified yet.
#
RewriteRule ^gone$ - [R=410,L,QSA]


# Requests to resources that were not defined above
# ------------------------------------------
# Catch identifers not yet caught until here, and redirect the user to a 404 page to explain this fact:
#
RewriteRule "^\/(.+)$" "-" [R=404,L,QSA]
