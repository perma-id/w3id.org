PERICLES (http://www.pericles-project.eu/)is a four-year project that aims to address the challenge of ensuring that digital content remains accessible in an environment that is subject to continual change. This can encompass not only technological change, but also changes in semantics, academic or professional practice, or society itself, which can affect the attitudes and interests of the various stakeholders that interact with the content. PERICLES will take a ‘preservation by design’ approach that involves modelling, capturing and maintaining detailed and complex information about digital content, the environment in which it exists, and the processes and policies to which it is subject.

This set of ontologies is produced in the WP3 (work package 3) led by the Xerox Research Center Europe (Jean-Yves Vion-Dury, Nikolaos Lagos, Jean-Pierre Chanod).

Usage: you may import all LRM ontologies through the LRM-schema.ttl main ontology (may have a look at LRM-document-change.ttl to see how an ontology instance refer the LRM ontology schema, and redefine the @base instruction to refer to the working directory where all .ttl modules are located)

Protégé works well with this set (import directly the turtle file LRM-schema.ttl or the LRM-document-change.ttl instance to see a toy example of both class refinement, instance model, and a basic change management case)
