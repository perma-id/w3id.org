Academia Industry DynAmics (AIDA) Knowlegde Graph
===================

Academia and industry share a complex, multifaceted, and symbiotic relationship. Analysing the knowledge flow between them, understanding which directions have the biggest potential, and discovering the best strategies to harmonise their efforts is a critical task for several stakeholders. While research publications and patents are an ideal media to analyse this space, current datasets of scholarly data can not be used for such a purpose since they lack a high-quality characterization of the relevant research topics and industrial sectors.
We introduce the Academia/Industry DynAmics (AIDA) Knowledge Graph, which describes 14M publications and 8M patents according to the research topics drawn from the Computer Science Ontology. 4M publications and 5M patents are further characterized according to the type of the author's affiliations (academy, industry, or collaborative) and 66 industrial sectors (e.g., automotive, financial, energy, electronics) organized in a two-level taxonomy.
AIDA was generated by an automatic pipeline that integrates data from Microsoft Academic Graph, Dimensions, DBpedia, the Computer Science Ontology, and the Global Research Identifier Database. It is publicly available under CC BY 4.0 and can be downloaded as a dump or queried via a triplestore.
