This redirect is used to direct URIs for terms, checklists, packages and other documents related to GSC standards.

The top-level redirects to the GSC website, which is currently house on a private server but will soon be hosted on github at https://github.com/GenomicsStandardsConsortium/gensc.github.io.

The Minimum Information about any (x) sequence standards are the first to get permanent URIs and will be in a sub-domain of this redirect which is wid.org/gensc/mixs
