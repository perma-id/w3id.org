## Redirect for the ORCA-X

ORCA-X is a set of extensions to the ORCA Ontology
hosted at http://vocab.deri.ie/orca

It creates several new subclasses by OWL2 punning of entities that 
are modelled as Individuals in the original ontology.  It also adds 4 new 
subclasses of "CertaintyLevel" that reflect the categories 
identified in the Prieto & Wilkinson certainty survey study 
(publication pending)
