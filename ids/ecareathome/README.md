# E-care@home
E-care@Home is a Swedish interdisciplinary distributed research environment that pulls together competences in
Artificial Intelligence, Semantic Web, Internet of Things and Sensors for Health.

A current vision in the area of ICT-supported independent living of the elderly involves populating the home 
with connected electronic devices (“things”) such as sensors and actuators and linking them to the Internet. 
Creating such an Internet-of-Things infrastructure (IoT) is done with the ambition to provide automated information
gathering and processing on top of which e-services for the elderly residing in their homes can be built hence, E-care@home.
