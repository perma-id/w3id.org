# Artivity Project

The Artivity Project aims to produce an open desktop logging framework for arts practice. 
It allows for capturing detailed data about the creation process of digital artwork and 
its context. This data can be used to study the techniques, workflow and sources of 
inspiration in the creation process of digital media. The project is executed as a 
cooperation with the University of the Arts, London and Semiodesk GmbH. It is currently 
funded by JISC.
