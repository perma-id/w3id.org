# HAPS - Holistic Attack Prevention System

The project aims at developing a software solution for automatic “cyber defense” of critical applications.
The system will be able to predict information on possible vulnerabilities thanks to a learning component that will leverage: 

* the source code of the target application (SAST metrics) 
* the information generated during its use ( application log, network status, system status).

The proposed approach, which pushes the state of the art of industrial solutions, aims to drastically improve the effectiveness of the SAST analysis by integrating it with information that is specific to the system under examination and therefore takes into account possible mitigation elements, already in place.

## Ontology

The HAPS Ontology models attacks to and vulnerabilities of Web applications. The ontology is available in the [ont folder](https://github.com/anuzzolese/haps/tree/master/ont).
