# ResRiskOnto

ResRiskOnto is an application ontology for risks in the oil & gas industry associated to the petroleum reservoir domain. The terms comprised in this ontology are
composed of words dominated by reservoir professionals, so that it can be easily adopted in future risk documentation.

This ontology follows the principles of the Basic Formal Ontology (BFO). The BFO is a top-level ontology designed to describe scientific domains. On the domain-level, reservoir entities are described under the principles of the GeoCore Ontology, a core ontology for Geology.

This ontology is part of a Msc. Thesis in PUC-Rio. 
We will soon provide updates on ontological analysis ResRiskOnto entities, as well as references for citations.
