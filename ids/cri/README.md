# CRI association namespace

## Presentation
This is the redirection to the CRI (https://cri-association.fr/) namespace. CRI is an independant research collective willing to produce open science and data in many fields, including but not limited to computer science, citizenship and social sciences.

Some of the members being semantic Web experts, the existence of a namespace will enable the durable publication of ontologies.
