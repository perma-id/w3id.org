#  Flex Ledger

A data model and syntax for expressing a set of ordered events in a decentralized system in way that can be cryptographically verified. This technology is useful when coordinating the recording of events, such as financial transactions, transfer of property, or time-stamped data that must be shared among coordinating parties. A primary goal of this ledger format is flexibility, allowing the pluggability of consensus algorithms, data structures for recording history, and the type of data that can be stored in the ledger.
