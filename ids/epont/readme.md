# Epigraphic Ontology

https://w3id.org/epont is the namespace for the ontologies and vocabularies for the modelling of Epigraphic Documents.

The OWL Ontology is under development and will be namespaced https://w3id.org/epont/ontology.
The included implementation of CRM-Tex as OWL Ontology is under development and will be redirected from the stable https://w3id.org/epont/crmtex although the namespace used is already http://www.cidoc-crm.org/crmtex/.

Data will be maintained by the Epigraphy.info Ontology and Linked Data Working Group represented here by [Pietro Liuzzo](https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5714-4011).

The document describing Modelling will be published on the Epigraphy.info website.
