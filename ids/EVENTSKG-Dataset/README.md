# EVENTSKG Dataset
EVENTSKG, A dataset of scientific events, containing historical data about the publications, submissions, start date, end date, location and homepage.
EVENTSKG contains 73 event series ( i.e. 75\% additional event series) belonging to eight CS communities: Artificial Intelligence (AI), Software and its engineering (SE), world wide Web (WEB), Security and privacy (SEC), Information systems (IS), Computer systems organization (CSO), Human Centered Computing (HCC) and Theory of Computation (TOC) (two more communities have been added, i.e. HCC and TOC).
The dataset is publicly available online in three different formats (i.e. CSV, XML and RDF).


## Documentation
A human readable documentation of the dataset is available [here](https://saidfathalla.github.io/EVENTSKG-Dataset/).

## Metadata representation model
A notable feature of this release is the use of the updated version of the Scientific Events Ontology (SEO) http://sda.tech/SEOontology/Documentation/SEO.html as a reference ontology for event metadata representation.
