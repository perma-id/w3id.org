Repository for redirecting to ontologies of the CEF Open Data-funded European project WHOW - Water Health Open Knowledge
===================

We intend to use w3id.org in order to obtain persistent URIs for the network of ontologies we are developing in the context of the CEF EU funded project [WHOW Project](https://whowproject.eu). The network is developed by the partners of the project namely Celeris (coordinator), ISPRA (Italian Institute of Environmental Research), Aria SpA (in-house of Italian Lombardy region) and the Institute of Cognitive Sciences and Technologies (Semantic Technologies Laboratory - STLab) of the Italian National Research Council (CNR).

We initially plan to create:
+ `w3id.org/whow/onto` for all the ontologies of the network mentioned above;
+ `w3id.org/whow/controlled-vocabulary` for all the controlled vocabularies;
+ `w3id.org/whow/data` for all the other types of data;


Some redirect rules will be to the [github repository of the project](https://github.com/whow-project) we are using as working repo, open to all; others to the CNR server.
