The incremental LOD Dataset relation index

About:
LOD Dataset relation index was developed with the intention to provide an index of the relations among the LOD Datasets.
We execute this task to verify which properties the datasets are sharing in order to see how similar those RDF datasets are. We compare by exact match, by the similarity of the names and by instance similarity.

Just to make it clear, here we have two aims (1) Discover similar datasets according to his properties and (2) discover which datasets contain a certain set of properties.

This is part of my PhD studies.
