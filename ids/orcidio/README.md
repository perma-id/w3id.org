# ORCID in OWL

This [W3ID](https://w3id.org/) provides a persistent URI namespace for ORCID in OWL resources.

## Uses

ORCID in OWL is an ontology that wraps notable ORCID identifiers as named individuals so they can be more easily included in other ontologies (e.g., OBO Ontologies) and empower Protege to show rich label information for `dc:contributor` annotations.
