# Repository for redirecting to ontologies data and controlled vocabularies of the Italian project LEO (Livestock Environment Open data)

We intend to use w3id.org in order to obtain persistent URIs for the Italian project [LEO](https://www.leo-italy.eu/) (Livestock Environment Open data).

We are planning to create:
* w3id.org/leo/onto for all the ontologies that are going to be created during the project;
* w3id.org/leo/controlled-vocabulary for all the controlled vocabularies of the project;
* w3id.org/italia/data for all the linked open data that are going to be produced following the ontologies.

The redirect will be to the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Bluarancio/Leo-OpenData) we are using as working repo, open to all communities.
