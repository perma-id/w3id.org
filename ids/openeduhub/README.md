# OpenEduHub

The OpenEduHub-project is project funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research and offers a platform to search for resources, platforms and tools in the context of education(<https://wirlernenonline.de>).

One of the goals of this project is to provide machine readable metadata and vocabulary for learning objects.
