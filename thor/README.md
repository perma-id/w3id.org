# THOR Project

ThOR stands for “Thesaurus and Ontology Representation”. The ThOR Project was a collaboration project that happened in 2021 between the [*Zorginstituut Nederland* (ZIN)](https://english.zorginstituutnederland.nl/) – the Dutch National Health Care Institute – and the [Conceptual and Cognitive Modeling Research Group (CORE)](https://www.inf.unibz.it/krdb/core/) from the [Free University of Bozen-Bolzano (Unibz)](https://unibz.it/).

The project generated two artifacts: [Ontolex2SKOS](https://github.com/unibz-core/ontolex2skos) and the [Thor Ontology](https://github.com/unibz-core/thor-ontology) vocabulary.

## Ontolex2SKOS

[Ontolex2SKOS](https://github.com/unibz-core/ontolex2skos) is an automated model-driven transformation for generating [SKOS](https://www.w3.org/TR/skos-reference/) thesauri from [Ontolex-Lemon](https://www.w3.org/2016/05/ontolex/) lexicons. It allows organizations to have both lexicons and thesauri while building only the former. The domain-independent rules encoded in the transformation comply with strict requirements to guarantee that the output thesaurus is consistent with the input lexicon while allowing any change in the input data to be easily reflected in the output. Ontolex2SKOS was created to encompass domain-specific lexicons and is domain-independent.

## Thor Ontology

The objective of **ThOR Ontology** is to provide a vocabulary for building lexicons and thesauri for a same domain. The OWL implementation of the ThOR Ontology is designed to provide an implementation artifact to structure a knowledge base (or knowledge graph), being suitable for Semantic Web and Linked Data applications. The ThOR Ontology uses concepts from [SKOS](https://www.w3.org/TR/skos-reference/), [Ontolex-Lemon](https://www.w3.org/2016/05/ontolex/), and [Lexinfo](https://github.com/ontolex/lexinfo), complementing them for accomplishing the purpose of being used for representing a lexicon that can be further transformed into a thesaurus using a specific tool built for this purpose, the [Ontolex2SKOS](https://github.com/unibz-core/ontolex2skos).
