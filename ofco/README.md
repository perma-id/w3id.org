OFCO ontology : Orphanet Functionnal Consequences Ontology
Orphanet provides information on activity limitation/participation restriction (functional consequences) described in rare diseases, using the Orphanet Functionnal Consequences Ontology (OFCO), derived and adapted from the International Classification of Functioning (ICF), Disability and Health (WHO) https://icd.who.int/browse/2025-01/icf/en
The provided information is assessed from the whole patients’ population affected by the disease, receiving standard care and management (specific and/or symptomatic management, prevention and prophylaxis, devices and aids, care and support). Functional consequences are organised by their frequency in the patients’ population.
