## Description

The **BIM-IoT Integration Ontology** provides a semantic bridge between Building Information Modeling (BIM) systems and Internet of Things (IoT) sensor networks. It facilitates unified knowledge representation and interoperability across physical building components and real-time IoT data streams.

This ontology is developed to support intelligent Operation and Maintenance (O&M) in smart infrastructure, such as transportation hubs, large-scale buildings, and complex facility environments.

It integrates concepts from:
- BIM entities (e.g., IfcBuildingElement, IfcWall, IfcSpace)
- IoT constructs (e.g., Sensor, Observation, Location)
- Deployment semantics (e.g., `deployedIn`, `has_unit`, equivalence classes)

Use cases include:
- Cross-domain rule reasoning
- Ontology-based integration between static building data and dynamic IoT streams
- Support for event detection, energy monitoring, and spatial analytics
