The Energy Domain Ontology standardizes knowledge representation for industrial energy assets (refineries, power plants, renewables), enabling interoperability across design, construction, and operation. It combines restriction-based OWL modeling with lifecycle-aware patterns, initially supporting IFC and designed for future expansion to ISO 15926/CFIHOS. Validated by domain experts, it addresses the unique semantic gaps in energy systems.
