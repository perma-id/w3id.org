# ARTO — Artwork Object Ontology

The *Artwork Object Ontology* (**ARTO**) is a comprehensive ontology designed for describing and contextualizing artworks. It consists of two main components: the *Artwork Descriptive Model* and the *Artwork Contextual Model*. ARTO aims to provide a structured and detailed representation of artworks, facilitating tasks such as artwork captioning and information retrieval.

## Knowledge Graph Construction Pipeline (for ARTO)

The *Kowledge Graph Construction Pipeline* (*KGCP*) includes a comprehensive prompt engineering workflow, including actual prompt templates for each phase. The workflow consists of three main phases: Task Analysis, Prompt Generation, and Testing & Optimization.
