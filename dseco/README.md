## Uses

This namespace is subdivided into varied subspaces depending on the targeted function.
The main related resource is [https://github.com/Orange-OpenSource/dseco](https://github.com/Orange-OpenSource/dseco).

## Testings

See the test examples within the *.htaccess* file.

Testing the [.htaccess](.htaccess) rules before merging with the main w3id.org branch is possible with the [Htaccess Tester](https://htaccess.madewithlove.com/) Web site.
For this, remove `dseco/` from the URL path to test (e.g. `https://w3id.org/dseco/ontology/` => `https://w3id.org/ontology/`), then press the *Test* button.
