## URL Patterns

- `https://w3id.org/gaia-x4plcaad/ontologies/{ontology}/v{version}/` - Ontology namespace (for prefix)
- `https://w3id.org/gaia-x4plcaad/ontologies/{ontology}/v{version}` - Ontology IRI (for owl:Ontology)
- `https://w3id.org/gaia-x4plcaad/ontologies/{ontology}/v{version}/shapes` - SHACL shapes

## Resolution

W3ID IRIs resolve to static files published on GitHub Pages. Use the documentation site for the full catalog and links to each published file.
