# The Tate SKOS Subject Hierarchy

This repository features a [SKOS](https://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/) taxonomy generated from [Tate's 3-level subject hierarchy](https://github.com/tategallery/collection/tree/master/processed/subjects) through the use of the [CASPAR](https://caspar.catalink.eu/) semantic data integration framework.

Documentation and specification found [here](https://github.com/catalink-eu/tate-skos).
