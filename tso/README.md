# TUBES System Ontology
This [W3ID](https://w3id.org) provides a persistent URI namespace for the TUBES System Ontology (tso).

## Uses
The scope of the TUBES ontology is to explicitly define the topology of interconnected building service system and their components. As a lightweight ontology it has a strong alignment to other ontologies within the W3C community and aims to provide the means to link infor­ mation at data level within the AEC industry.
