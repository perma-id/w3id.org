**Name of the project:** [MOSAIC - Multimodal Ontology for Social, Abstract and Intangible Concepts](https://github.com/delfimpandiani/mosaic/)

**Description:** Automatic Modeling of (Highly Abstract) Social Concepts evoked by Art Images. This project aims to investigate, model, and experiment with how and why social concepts (such as violence, power, peace, or destruction) are modeled and detected by humans and machines in images. It specifically focuses on the detection of social concepts referring to non-physical objects in (visual) art images, as these concepts are powerful tools for visual data management, especially in the Cultural Heritage field (present in resources such Iconclass and Getty Vocabularies). The hypothesis underlying this research is that we can formulate a description of a social concept as a multimodal frame, starting from a set of observations (in this case, image annotations). We believe thaat even with no explicit definition of the concepts, a “common sense” description can be (approximately) derived from observations of their use.

This is the ontological module underlying the Multimodal Ontology for Social, Abstract and Intangible Concepts (MOSAIC) project, which aims to investigate, model, and experiment with how and why abstract social concepts (such as violence, power, peace, or destruction) are annotated by humans and machines as evocation of different information objects.\
It  uses the Descriptions and Situations (DnS) ontology design pattern in a modular way, to represent data annotated with abstract social concepts such as images. 
It is furthermore aligned to DUL - Dolce Ultralight foundational Ontology and imports synset and frame evocation classes from the Framester hub.
The MOSAIC ontology is used to record and query annotation situations (including the time, place, annotator, and remuneration scheme involved in them) in which these concepts have been used to annotate common-sense, distributional, and sensory-perceptual data.
