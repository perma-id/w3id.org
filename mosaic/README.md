**Name of the project:** [MOSAIC - Multimodal Ontology for Social, Abstract and Intangible Concepts](https://github.com/delfimpandiani/mosaic/)

**Description:**
This is the ontological module underlying the Multimodal Ontology for Social, Abstract and Intangible Concepts (MOSAIC) project, which aims to investigate, model, and experiment with how and why abstract social concepts (such as violence, power, peace, or destruction) are annotated by humans and machines as evocation of different information objects.\
It  uses the Descriptions and Situations (DnS) ontology design pattern in a modular way, to represent data annotated with abstract social concepts such as images. 
It is furthermore aligned to DUL - Dolce Ultralight foundational Ontology and imports synset and frame evocation classes from the Framester hub.
The MOSAIC ontology is used to record and query annotation situations (including the time, place, annotator, and remuneration scheme involved in them) in which these concepts have been used to annotate common-sense, distributional, and sensory-perceptual data.
