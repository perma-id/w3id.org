## Linked-data API for Networked Drones (LANDRS), Drone Ontology

This permanent w3id is meant to provide a persistent namespace for the [LANDRS](https://www.landrs.org) project. The drone ontology provides support for using linked data collection on unmanned, remotely piloted or robotic vehicles. We provide two namespaces, in these redirects. One for rdf/owl ontologies at https://w3id.org/drone/ont, and one for SHACL shapes https://w3id.org/drone/shapes/shacl. The URIs are structured to support Shex versions of the shapes at a later date.

Ontology development and issue submissions are in the Github repository [https://github.com/landrs-toolkit/drone](https://github.com/landrs-toolkit/drone). For more information on the project see our homepage [LANDRS](https://www.landrs.org).

https://w3id.org/drone redirects to https://www.landrs.org/drone for the ontology overview documentation

https://w3id.org/drone/ont redirects to https://www.landrs.org/drone/release/ontology/latest/index-en.html for the html human readable content type.

https://w3id.org/drone/ont/{version} redirects to https://www.landrs.org/drone/release/ontology/{version}/index-en.html for the html human readable content type.

https://w3id.org/drone/shapes/shacl redirects to https://www.landrs.org/drone/release/shapes/shacl/latest/index-en.html for the html human readable content type.

https://w3id.org/drone/shapes/shacl/{version} redirects to https://www.landrs.org/drone/release/shapes/shacl/index-en.html for the html human readable content type.

Each w3id URI supports content-negotiation for text/turtle, application/rdf+xml, application/n-triples, application/ld+json
