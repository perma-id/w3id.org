# INBIO: Invasion Biology Ontology
The Invasion Biology Ontology (INBIO) contains terms and concepts relevant in the field of invasion biology, which is a research area dealing with the translocation, establishment, 
spread, impact and management of species outside of their native ranges, where they are called non-native or alien species. This first version of the ontology covers terms and concepts 
needed to describe twelve major invasion hypotheses building the hierarchical hypothesis network (see also Jeschke JM, Heger T (Eds) (2018) Invasion Biology: Hypotheses and Evidence. CABI, Wallingford, UK).
