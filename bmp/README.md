# BMP_BuildingMaterialPerformance

The Building Material Performance ontology classifies construction materials based on categories, types, and property groups. Each property group contains multiple material parameters that are based on building physics and thus enable building information models to be enriched with highly aggregated information with respect to material information modelling and material simulation.
