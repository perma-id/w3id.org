<h3>Instantiating the EEP ODP <span class="backlink"> back to <a href="#toc">ToC</a></span></h3>

<p>This section shows an example of instantiating the EEP ODP. Let us consider a farm scenario where poultry are reared. In this case, a sensor (<i>:sensor36</i>) deployed in the farm (<i>:farm</i>) is in charge of measuring both farm's temperature and humidity (i.e.,
<i>:farmTemperature</i> and <i>:farmHumidity</i>). Furthermore, this sensor implements a
monitoring procedure (<i>:monitoringProc</i>) to make two observations <i>:obs13</i> and
<i>:obs14</i>. Figure 2 represents this example (for the sake of simplicity, the <i>rdf:type</i> relationships are not shown)</p>
