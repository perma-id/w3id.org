# Ontobio: Biographical Ontology    

Ontobio is a comprehensive Biographical Ontology founded upon the Linked Data principles. It is an overarching framework that would capture the richness and diversity of an individual’s life. Ontobio is designed following a tripartite approach of Personality, Environment/Milieu, and Achievements/Milestones. These facets are supplemented with an expressive vocabulary designed to encapsulate the biographical minutiae.
