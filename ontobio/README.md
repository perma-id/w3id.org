# Ontobio: Metadata for Ontology Description and publication 

This project consists in building an application profile to capture metadata information for semantic artifacts (e.g., ontologies, thesaurus) and the other related objects (e.g., semantic artifact catalogue records).  

Ontobio is a comprehensive biographical knowledge model founded upon the Linked Data principles. Ontobio is designed following a tripartite approach of Personality, Environment and Milieu, and Achievements/ Milestones. These facets are supplemented with an expressive vocabulary designed to encapsulate the biographical minutiae.
