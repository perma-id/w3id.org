# SCO - Sustainability Core Ontology

SCO is a middle-level ontology, covering the terminology related to the three major theoretical challenges of sustainability Ubbiali et al. (2024):

The polysemy of the term sustainability.
The relationship between sustainability and sustainable development.
The complexity underlying sustainability.
SCO is designed to be the pivotal resource upon which to harmonize and integrate top-level and domain ontologies regarding sustainability.
