Repository for redirecting to dgarijo' resources.
===================

Repository created to store the redirections of the resources created by Daniel Garijo (https://github.com/dgarijo/). Some of these resources have duplicated permanent URLs from purl.org, which has disabled creating/editing new permanent URLs.
For the moment the repository stores two folders:

* Permanent redirections for the applications under development or developed by me.
* Redirections + content negotiation to the Research Objects I have created, modeled according to http://purl.org/wf4ever/ro# (it also has a w3id assigned)


In the future, it will store the redirections to the vocabularies I develop.
