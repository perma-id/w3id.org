# /faircookbook/
This [W3ID](https://w3id.org) provides a persistent URI namespace for FAIR cookbook resources.

## Uses
This namespace is used to mint GUPRIs for individual recipes which are part of the FAIR cookbook. 

## See also
See <https://fairplus.github.io/the-fair-cookbook> for more details on the FAIR cookbook. 

## Pool of maintainers of this namespace
The FAIR cookbook is part of the IMI FAIRplus project (see <https://www.imi.europa.eu/projects-results/project-factsheets/fairplus>). As such, a Consortium Agreement is in place which describes the Governance of the project and appoints a designated representative.

For the sake of simplicity, all people involved and interested in managing this namespace from the FAIRplus consortium can enter the pool of persons intended to be able to make changes in this namespace of w3id.org by being appointed by one of the current members of this pool.

The ultimate control over changes in this namespace lies naturally in the hands of the w3id.org GitHub repo maintainers 

The pool consists of (alphabetical order):

* https://github.com/AlasdairGray
* https://github.com/daniwelter
* https://github.com/egonw
* https://github.com/FAIRplus-admin
* https://github.com/FuqiX
* https://github.com/proccaserra
* https://github.com/robertgiessmann
* https://github.com/tburdett
* https://github.com/weiguUL
