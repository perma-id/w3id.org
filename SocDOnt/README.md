# SocDOnt - Social Document Ontology
The Social Document Ontology (SocDOnt) expresses the generic structure of social documents. At the micro-level a social document is defined as a composition of an intellectual entity enhanced by both intellectual and simple components and at the macro-level a collection is defined as an aggregation of social documents.
