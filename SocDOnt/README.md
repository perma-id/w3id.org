# SocDOnt - Social Document Ontology
The Social Document Ontology (SocDOnt) expresses the generic structure of **social documents**. At the micro-level a social document is defined as a composition of an **intellectual entity** enhanced by both **intellectual and simple components** and at the macro-level a collection is defined as an aggregation of social documents.
