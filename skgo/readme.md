# Science knowledge graph ontologies (SKGO)

The Science knowledge graph ontologies, a.k.a. SKGO, is a suite of OWL ontology models to capture the knowledge of scientific research data, via publications, by interlinking domain-specific information, and allow access of these data in a machine-readable, transparent and comparable manner. 

This suite captures the knowledge of scientific information typically presented in publications by interlinking domain-specific concepts in a highly structured format, thus enabling access to these data in a machine-readable, transparent and comparable manner.
Currently, SKGO comprises four OWL ontologies for scientific work in various fields of science, including:
  * Computer Science (SemSur),  
  * Physics (PhySci), and 
  * Pharmaceutical science (PharmSci) as well as 
  * Modern Science Ontology (ModSci).
  
This suite will support the digital transformation of scholarly communication from documents to knowledge-oriented representation in the form of structured and interlinked knowledge graphs, aiming at analyzing, exchanging, and exploiting scholarly knowledge in an efficient manner.
