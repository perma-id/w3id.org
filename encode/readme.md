# Bridging the <gap> in Ancient Writing Cultures: ENhance COmpetences in the Digital Era

https://w3id.org/encode is the namespace for the ontology and vocabulary of competences of the Erasmus+ Project [Bridging the <gap> in Ancient Writing Cultures: ENhance COmpetences in the Digital Era](https://site.unibo.it/encode/it).

The OWL Ontology is under development and will be namespaced https://w3id.org/encode/ontology.
The SKOS Vocabulary is under development and will be namespaced https://w3id.org/encode/vocabulary.
Entities will be defined in the Classes Module, Competence and Openinig, so that e.g. an entity  https://w3id.org/encode/modules/m1 may be defined and identified.

Data will be available on the database provided by Bibliotheca Hertziana. 
 
  Formerly this application and database was provided by Universit√§t Hamburg where it was developed by Daria Elagina.
