# HARD CODED REDIRECTS
# Future editor, please hard code (no patterns) _all_ redirects here, and make sure that none of the redirects
# clash or can theoretically clash with the resources pages. An easy way to do this is to use the full path to the 
# file in the redirect --> No resource will be "named like a path".
