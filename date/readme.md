# Linked Open Date Entities (LODE) 
https://vocabs.acdh.oeaw.ac.at/date_entities/en/

This is an Entity Model to describe historical dates. Currently, the entities provide lookups for the time concepts between 3000 BC and AD 3000, for the precision of day, month, year, decade, century, and millennium. It is complemented to the ACDH-CH Unit of Time Entities, which specifies the time unit concepts used for the time instances in this model. For example, the concept of the 2nd millennium (Date Entity) is an instance of the concept of millennium (Unit of Time Entity). The basic structure of the two Entity Models is based on the Wikidata ontology. However, SKOS is adopted 1) to capitalise its simple loose semantics, and 2) to avoid debates on a formal ontology on time concepts. Most relations of time concepts are described by skos:broader and skos:narrower. The specifications and policies of the two Entity Models are described below. More details on the project can be found in a paper in the 14th International Conference on Metadata and Semantics Research (MTSR 2020).
