The Computer Science Knowledge Graph
===================

In recent years, we saw the emergence of several approaches for producing machine-readable, semantically rich, interlinked description of the content of research publications, typically encoded as knowledge graphs. A common limitations of these solutions is that they address a low number of articles, either because they rely on human experts to summarize information from the literature or they focus on specific research areas.
 In this paper, we introduce the Computer Science Knowledge Graph (CS-KG), a large-scale knowledge graph composed by 43M statements from 7.3M articles about 10M entities linked by 38 semantic relationships.
 
 It was automatically generated and will be periodically updated by applying a machine learning pipeline on a large repository of research papers. CS-KG is much larger than all comparable solutions and offers a very comprehensive representation of tasks, methods, materials, and metrics in computer science able to support a variety of intelligent services, such as advanced literature search, document classification, article recommendation, trend forecasting, hypothesis generation, and many others. CS-KG was evaluated on a benchmark of manually annotated triples, yielding excellent results.
