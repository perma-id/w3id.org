The Computer Science Knowledge Graph
===================

In recent years, we saw the emergence of several approaches for producing machine-readable, semantically rich, interlinked descriptions of the content of research publications, typically encoded as knowledge graphs. A common limitation of these solutions is that they address a low number of articles, either because they rely on human experts to summarize information from the literature or because they focus on specific research areas.
 

 The knowledge graph contains more than 24.7M entities and 67.5M relationships and enables performing new studies to assess the research landscape in topics like trend analysis, scientific hypothesis generation, and link prediction.
CS-KG v2: Computer Science Knowledge Graph (CS-KG), a large-scale knowledge graph composed of 67.5M statements from 14.5M articles about 24.7M entities.
CS-KG v1: Computer Science Knowledge Graph (CS-KG), a large-scale knowledge graph composed of 43M statements from 7.3M articles about 10M entities.
 
CS-KG is automatically generated and will be periodically updated by applying a machine learning pipeline on a large repository of research papers. CS-KG is much larger than all comparable solutions and offers a very comprehensive representation of tasks, methods, materials, and metrics in computer science able to support a variety of intelligent services, such as advanced literature search, document classification, article recommendation, trend forecasting, hypothesis generation, and many others. CS-KG was evaluated on a benchmark of manually annotated triples, yielding excellent results.
