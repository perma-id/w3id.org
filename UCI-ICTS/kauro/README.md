This W3ID provides a **persistent, version-independent URL** for the
[Kauro / Formerly MIA (Medical Informatics Assistant)](https://github.com/UCI-ICTS/mia) project maintained by the [UCI Institute for Clinical and Translational Science (ICTS)](https://icts.uci.edu/).

### Redirect behavior
- `https://w3id.org/UCI-ICTS/kauro` → `https://github.com/UCI-ICTS/mia`  
- `https://w3id.org/UCI-ICTS/kauro/docs` → `https://github.com/UCI-ICTS/mia/tree/main/docs`  
- `https://w3id.org/UCI-ICTS/kauro/schemas/v1.0` → `https://github.com/UCI-ICTS/mia/tree/main/schemas/v1.0`  

This mapping supports long-term stability for references to schemas, documentation,
and metadata, even if the repository structure changes in the future.
