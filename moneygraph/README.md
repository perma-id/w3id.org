Moneygraph is a project to use RDF, OWL ontologies, and graph databases to model and implement a personal investment portfolio database.

The Moneygraph namespaces are:

`PREFIX mg: <https://w3id.org/moneygraph/ns/ontology/>` # Definitions of Moneygraph # classes, properties, and named individual.

`PREFIX mgx: <https://w3id.org/moneygraph/ns/taxonomy/>` # Instances of classes that may be organized as a taxonomy. This includes simple lists and tree-like hierachies of concepts. Control of taxonomies is often delegated to specific business units or departments.

`PREFIX mg3: <https://w3id.org/moneygraph/ns/data/>` # Triples involving regular data

Eventually this will have a more public face at https://moneygraph.info
