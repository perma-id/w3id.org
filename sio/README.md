### Structural Information Ontology

The SIO (Structural Information Ontology) describes data acquisition and data management in structural diagnostics. It covers several methods of low-destructive and non-destructive testing. The ontology was developed as part of the [openSIM](https://bmdv.bund.de/SharedDocs/DE/Artikel/DG/mfund-projekte/opensim.html) research project and was primarily developed by [MKP](https://marxkrontal.com/) in collaboration with the [Chair of Intelligent Technical Design](https://www.uni-weimar.de/en/civil-and-environmental-engineering/chairs/intelligent-technical-design/) of Bauhaus-Universität Weimar.
