## Factory-X

Factory-X is a Dataspace similar to [Catena-X](../catenax/README.md) that uses W3C VCs and ODRL Policy objects to
facilitate trust between participants. All relevant protocols serving those payloads use JSON-LD, so the relevant
redirects will mostly facilitate access to JSON-LD contexts and JSON schemas.
