# City Data Model

## Uses

The City Data Model is an effort to standardize definitions of data used within smart and sustainable cities and communities. The content of the models are developed in an open community on GitHub but are ultimately standardized in the ISO/IEC 5087 series. The part numbers contained in the w3id address correspond to the part numbers of the document series.

* Part 1: Foundation level concepts
* Part 2: City level concepts
* Part 3: Service level concepts for transport

For now, the files are maintained under the [TC 204 website](https://github.com/ISO-TC204/ontology-cdm-p#) (where # indicates the part number). It is expected that this site will migrate to a new site once the project migrates from ISO/IEC JTC1 WG 11 to the new ISO/IEC JTC4 and a new GitHub account is created.
