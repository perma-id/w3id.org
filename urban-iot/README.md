Urban IoT Ontologies designed to support the integration and pubblication of data from different service providers operating IoT devices in an urban area. The ontologies were developed for the Municipality of Milano (Italy), but they are generic and can be applied to any other city, and they are available on the github repository https://github.com/Comune-Milano/ontologie-iot-urbani.

The first two ontologies focus on Sharing Mobility (Car, Bike, Moto, Micro-Mobility Sharing) and Charging Stations for Electric Mobility.

The first version of the Urban IoT suite of ontologies is composed by:
- *Core* Module: [https://w3id.org/urban-iot/core](https://w3id.org/urban-iot/core) (preferred prefix _uiot:_)
- *Sharing Mobility* Module: [https://w3id.org/urban-iot/sharing](https://w3id.org/urban-iot/sharing) (preferred prefix _uiots:_)
- *Electric Mobility* Module: [https://w3id.org/urban-iot/electric](https://w3id.org/urban-iot/electric) (preferred prefix _uiote:_)

Ontologies are complemented by a set of thesauri (SKOS vocabularies) using the same namespace and referenced in the different modules.
