Circular Factory Ontologies
===

An ontology suite for the circular factory. The vision is to enable integrated linear and circular production on an industrial scale. This should translate used products into current product generations in order to achieve the vision of the perpetual product.

The objective is to provide shared knowledge models between different systems developed as part of the circular factory including product design, modeling and control of the circular factory through product-production co-design, modeling of individual product instances, human demonstrations and the autonomous and modular production system. 

The initial Circular Factory Ontologies have been defined in the SFB1574 Circular Factory for
the perpetual innovative product funded by the DFB (Germany Research Foundation)
