# Welcome to My Profile

The purpose of creating this permID is to make available academic and professional contributions to the community of applied ontologies, Semantic Web, and Knowledge Graphs.

## About Me

I am a dedicated researcher at the Semantics, Cybersecurity and Services Group, University of Twente, and at the UGent Business Informatics Group, Ghent University. My work focuses on applied ontologies, particularly in the use and development of OntoUML. I am also deeply interested in the Semantic Web and Knowledge Graphs, which are essential in improving the way information is interconnected and used in the digital environment.
