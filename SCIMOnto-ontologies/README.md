This repository hosts six interrelated domain ontologies developed for the Station-City Integrated Maintenance Ontology Framework (SCIMOF). These ontologies are designed to facilitate semantic modeling and reasoning for intelligent operation and maintenance (O&M) of urban rail transit hubs.

## Included Ontologies
- `CFMO.owl` â€” **Crowd Flow Monitoring Ontology**
CFMO captures the spatiotemporal characteristics of crowd movement in large public spaces, enabling semantic representation of people flow, density, direction, and activity patterns for intelligent crowd management.  
- `ECMO.owl` â€” **Energy Consumption Monitoring Ontology**
This ontology models concepts related to the monitoring and analysis of energy consumption within smart buildings and infrastructures. It supports semantic integration of sensor data such as electricity, HVAC, and lighting usage.
- `EvMO.owl` â€” **Environmental Monitoring Ontology**
EvMO represents various environmental parametersâ€”such as temperature, humidity, air quality, and noise levelsâ€”to support context-aware monitoring and adaptive decision-making in built environments.
- `IMO.owl` â€” **Incident Monitoring Ontology**
IMO provides a structured semantic framework to describe, classify, and reason about abnormal or emergency events occurring in urban or building-scale scenarios, including fire, accidents, and system failures.
- `SMO.owl` â€” **Structural Monitoring Ontology**
This ontology focuses on representing the physical condition of structural components, supporting semantic interpretation of stress, displacement, vibration, and structural damage for health monitoring.
- `SCIMOnto.owl` â€” **Station-City Integrated Maintenance Ontology Framework**
SCIMOF integrates five domain ontologies (ECMO, CFMO, EvMO, IMO, SMO) into a unified semantic framework to support cross-domain intelligent operation and maintenance in smart railway stations and urban systems.

## Key Features
- Modular Domain Design Ensuring Semantic Clarity and Maintainability
- Unified Semantic Integration for Bridging Cross-Domain Data Silos
- Support for Semantic Reasoning Rules to Enhance Intelligent Analysis
- Alignment with Upper Ontologies for Improved Interoperability and Compatibility
- Real-World Data Adaptability Enabling Semantic-Driven Smart O&M

## Use Cases
- Structural Safety Risk Detection During Crowd Peaks in Railway Stations
- Event-Driven Emergency Response and Dispatch Optimization
- Abnormal Building Energy Consumption Detection and Behavior Feedback
- Multi-Source Anomaly Detection and Alerting in Monitoring Areas
- Semantic-Driven Automatic Planning and Scheduling of O&M Tasks
