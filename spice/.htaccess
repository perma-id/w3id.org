# Name of the project: SPICE H2020 (https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/870811)
#
# Description: The overall aim of the project is to foster diverse participation
# in the heritage domain through a process of ""citizen curation"". Citizens will
# be supported to: develop their own personal interpretations of cultural objects;
# work together to present their collective view of life through culture and heritage;
# and gain an appreciation of alternative cultural viewpoints.
# Methods will be codesigned that can be used by citizen groups to produce personal
# interpretations of cultural objects and analyse and compare them against the
# interpretations of others. Tools will be developed for modelling users and groups
# and recommending content in a way that assists citizen groups in building a
# representation of themselves and appreciating variety within groups and similarity across
# groups to enhance social cohesion. A Linked Data infrastructure will support citizen
# curation using social media platforms in a way that gives heritage institutions control
# over rights protected digital assets and access to citizens responses to their collections.
# User experiences will be designed that enable inclusive participation in citizen curation
# activities across cultures and abilities. A series of citizen curation case studies with
# a diverse set of museums and citizen groups will demonstrate how the approach can promote
# inclusive participation and social cohesion in a variety of contexts.
# The project brings together 13 partners from 7 countries. The consortium comprises:
# three SMEs from the visitor guide (GVAM), mobile game (PadaOne) and data mining
# (CELI) sectors; four heritage institutions (Design Museum Helsinki, Irish Museum
# of Modern Art, Gallery of Modern Art Turin, Hecht Museum); and seven research
# centres (Bologna, Aalto, Aalborg, OU, UCM, Turin, Haifa) with expertise in codesign,
# museology, HCI, Linked Data, narratology, ontologies, visualisation and user modelling.
