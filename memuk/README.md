# MEMUK

MEMUK stands for the Melodic Music Knowledge Graph.

The endpoint [https://w3id.org/memuk](https://w3id.org/memuk) contains all the necessary code to build and replicate the MEMUK knowledge graph, and the original dataset.

The endpoint [https://w3id.org/memuk/resource](https://w3id.org/memuk/resource) redirects to the repository containing the whole knowledge graph.

The endpoint [https://w3id.org/memuk/ontology/meis](https://w3id.org/memuk/ontology/meis) redirects to the ontology structure for MEI files.

## P.S.:
This knowledge graph was created as part of my bachelorâ€™s thesis work.
