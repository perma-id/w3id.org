## OSC-EM Schemas
The **Open Standards Community for Electron Microscopy (OSC-EM)** is a community of scientists, developers, and users interested in standardizing and sharing **electron microscopy metadata**.

Central to this effort is the **OSC-EM Schema**, which defines a common metadata format for electron microscopy data.
The schema is modular, allowing for the inclusion of diverse experimental techniques and data types.
OSC-EM can be used to store metadata for the full data lifecycle, from data acquisition through processing and deposition.
