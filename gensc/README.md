## Redirect for the Genomics Standards Consortium

The Genomic Standards Consortium currently has two w3id namespaces:
- `gensc`
- `mixs`

The `mixs` namespace is more actively maintained, but some resources, like [Darwin Core](https://dwc.tdwg.org/) may need to temporarily use the `gensc` namespace.

Therefore, this `.htaccess` file redirects URLs in the form https://w3id.org/gensc/terms/MIXS:0000002 to https://w3id.org/mixs/0000002

That is in turn redirected according to the `mixs` namespace rules.

All other `gensc` URLs are redirected to the [GSC website](https://www.gensc.org/).

Established maintainer of this w3id: Ramona Walls rlwalls2008@gmail.org.

New maintainer to be added pending Ramona's approval: Mark Andrew Miller MAM@lbl.gov

Questions should be directed to https://github.com/GenomicsStandardsConsortium/mixs/issues.
