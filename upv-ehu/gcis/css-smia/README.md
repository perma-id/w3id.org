# CSS ontology for SMIA approach 

## Overview

This W3ID provides a persistent URI namespace for the Capability-Skill-Service (CSS) ontology adapted for the Self-configurable Manufacturing Industrial Agent (SMIA) approach.

This proposal extends another W3ID ontology: [https://w3id.org/hsu-aut/css](https://w3id.org/hsu-aut/css) (MIT license).

### SMIA-related links

To learn about the SMIA approach, here are some useful links:

- [:octocat: **SMIA official GitHub**](https://github.com/ekhurtado/SMIA/)
- [:blue_book: **SMIA full documentation**](https://smia.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
- [:hammer: **SMIA PyPI package**](https://pypi.org/project/smia/)

## Redirects

There are two types of redirects configured:

- If the W3ID is requested with a browser (HTML request), the request is redirected to the SMIA GitHub repository home page.
- If an RDF/XML version is requested (e.g. when using software such as Protégé to import the ontology), the request is redirected to the OWL file within the SMIA GitHub repository. A specific SMIA version can also be defined.
