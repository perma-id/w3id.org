# Linked-Fiestas: A  Knowledge Graph to Promote Cultural Tourism in Spain

Linked-Fiestas is a dataset that aims at providing data of festivals and events from not so well-known regions, so spreading their cultural heritage, bringing visibility to them, and thus, increasing tourists interest. Linked-Fiestas gathers data from well-known datasets, such as DBpedia and Wikidata, and from other datasets outside the Web of Data community such as fiesta.net or spain.info.

URI Patterns: https://w3id.org/linked-fiestas/resource/<id>

Content negociation for turtle, rdf/xml, and jsonld is performed through the .htaccess file.
