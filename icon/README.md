# /icon/
This [W3ID](https://w3id.org) provides a persistent URI namespace for the icon ontology and its documentation

## Uses
This namespace is broken down into different different parts:
* [https://w3id.org/icon/docs/](https://w3id.org/icon/docs/) leads to a [widoco](https://github.com/dgarijo/Widoco) visualization of the ontology.
* [https://w3id.org/icon/ontology/](https://w3id.org/icon/ontology/) leads to a raw owl file of the ontology (useful for imports)
* [https://w3id.org/icon/development/](https://w3id.org/icon/development/) leads to a github repository that contains the development documentation of the ontology.
* [https://w3id.org/icon/data/](https://w3id.org/icon/data/) leads to a RDF dataset of iconological interpretations described with the ICON ontology.
