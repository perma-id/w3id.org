# CovidO: The CoronaVirus Disease Ontology (CovidO)

# What is the CovidO ?
The CovidO ontology specifies a foundational metadata model set for real-world multimodal CoronaVirus. The CovidO provides an Ontological Framework for Representation and annotation of COVID-19 Information. This is an extension of CODO (COviD-19 Ontology) in real-world multimodal dimensions. 

Its structure depicts a conceptual framework that CoronaVirus Disease (Covid-19) applications can extend and use in their implementations, to define core concepts that capture a relevant and interoperable metadata vocabulary.
