# MLentory ZB MED/NFDI4DS registry for ML models
[MLentory](https://mlentory.zbmed.de/) is part of the [NFDI4DataScience](https://www.nfdi4datascience.de/) German consortium and is developed by the SemTec team at [ZB MED](https://zbmed.de/en). MLentory is a regsitry aggregating and harmonzing metadata for Machine Learning models, using [FAIR4ML](https://w3id.org/fair4ml) vocabulary. In addition, [Croissant ML](https://github.com/mlcommons/croissant) to represent datasets used for training or evaluation. The main object represented in MLentory is an ML model complemented with other related research artifacts such as software used to train or evaluate the model, data used to train or evaluate the model, or publications about the model.
