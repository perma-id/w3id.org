# MICOLL digital maps 

## Description
The MICOLL Map is a specialized web-based application aimed at researchers, particularly historians and experts, to explore and analyze historical routes. This tool utilizes a Web Mapping Service (WMS) to display these routes interactively, allowing users to delve into the detailed waypoints that make up each route.

Key features of the MICOLL Map include:

1.	**Interactive Visualization**: The application provides an interactive map interface where users can explore historical routes geographically.
2.	**Waypoint Analysis**: Each route on the MICOLL Map is composed of various waypoints. These waypoints can represent significant locations such as universities, fairs, ports, and other points of interest relevant to the historical context.
3.	**Supporting Evidence**: For each waypoint or segment of a route, the MICOLL Map offers access to supporting evidence. This evidence can include primary and secondary historical sources, such as documents, maps, or scholarly articles, which validate the historical significance of the routes and their waypoints.
4.	**Authorship and Source Attribution**: The application ensures transparency and academic rigor by attributing sources and evidence to their respective authors. This feature is crucial for researchers who need to verify the credibility and origins of the information provided.
5.	**Collaborative Research**: The platform is designed to support collaborative research efforts. Historians and experts can contribute to the map by adding new routes, waypoints, and supporting evidence, fostering a comprehensive and continuously updated resource.
