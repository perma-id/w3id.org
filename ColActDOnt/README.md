# ColActDOnt - Collaborative Actions on Documents Ontology
The Collaborative Actions on Documents Ontology (ColActDOnt) expresses the generic structure of actions on documents in collaborative systems. The **Event** is the main concept which relates to the involved entities **Account** and **Item** which are necessary to define a performed action. ColActDOnt is interwoven with the Social Document Ontology (SocDOnt) and builds on the structure of social documents.
