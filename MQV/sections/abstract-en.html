<h2>Abstract</h2><span class="markdown">
The Mapping Quality Vocabulary (MQV) provides a set of classes, properties, and restrictions that can be used to represent and interchange provenance information relating to the creation, quality assessment and quality refinement of mapping definitions used to generate Linked data datasets. It can also be specialized to create new classes and properties to model provenance information for mapping definitions in a specific mapping language.</span>
