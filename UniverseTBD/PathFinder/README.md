# pathfinder: A Semantic Framework for Literature Review and Knowledge Discovery in Astronomy
- `pathfinder` is an open-source publicly available tool that uses LLMs to answer natural-language astronomy questions using a corpus of ~350,000 peer-reviewed papers from ADS going back to 1990.  
- The framework is presented both as open-source code and as an online tool that can be used to find relevant literature, answer questions, and explore the corpus of papers.  
- The current version of the tool uses only abstracts, but can be extended to fulltext in the future.
