# UniverseTBD
We are a group of astronomers, machine learning enthusiasts, engineers, and enthusiasts, eminently human, coming from all over the world to make it happen. Our goal is to use foundation models to democratise *Astronomy* for everyone and expand our horizons on what's possible for the field moving forward.  

One of the big questions we want to answer is: Can Large Language Models come up with unique scientific insights and hypotheses? Stay fine-tuned.
