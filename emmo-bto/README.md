# Battery Testing Ontology (BTO)

Battery Testing Ontology

## Requirements

The BTO Ontology is built with an alignment with EMMO and some of its modules, as well as with the EMMO-compliant domain-level ontology CHAMEO. The following table describes the version compatibility between those ontologies:

| Imported Ontologies | Version           |
| ------------------- | ----------------- |
| EMMO                | 1.0.0-beta5       |
| CHAMEO              | 1.0.0-beta3       |
