# CO-META Ontology namespace

This namespace is created to host the **CO-META ontology**, developed at the [University of La Laguna](https://www.ull.es), Spain.  

The namespace provides persistent and resolvable IRIs for the ontology and its terms.  
Each request is redirected to the corresponding resources hosted in the [ontologies-ULL GitHub organization](https://github.com/ontologies-ULL/CO-META).
Content negotiation is supported, so different representations (HTML documentation, Turtle, RDF/XML, etc.) are served depending on the client's request.
