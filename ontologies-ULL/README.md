# ULL Ontologies namespace

This namespace is created to host a series of ontologies developed at the **University of La Laguna** ([www.ull.es](https://www.ull.es)), Spain.  

Each sub-level redirects to a different ontology, generally hosted in the [ontologies-ULL GitHub organization](https://github.com/ontologies-ULL).

---

## Example

- `https://w3id.org/ontologies-ull/OSDi` ‚Üí redirects to the ontology documentation (Widoco page).  
- `https://w3id.org/ontologies-ull/OSDi/ontology.ttl` ‚Üí redirects to the ontology in Turtle format (the htaccess file should be configured so that the previous link also redirects to the ontology for text/turtle HTTP requests).
