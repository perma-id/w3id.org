AFARCLOUD Ontology
===

Ontology developed inside the [AFarCloud project](http://www.afarcloud.eu/).

The ontology covers several domains:
- *Farm domain*: information related to crops and livestock. Some of the concepts for crops are based on the information model used in the [FOODIE project](https://foodie-cloud.com/).
- *Sensors domain*: information related to IoT devices in agriculture: sensors, actuators, collars. The model extends the SOSA/SSN ontology. 
- *Vehicles domain*: models vehicles (aerial, ground and underwater) and their autonomy. It extends the [SWARMs ontology](http://www.swarms.eu).
- *Mission domain*: provides a general representation of the mission composition and planning for autonomous and semi-autonomous vehicles. It is based on the [SWARMs ontology](http://www.swarms.eu).
