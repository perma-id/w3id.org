SKG-IF stands for *Scientific Knowledge Graph - Interoperability Framework*, which is a framework to enable a seamless exchange of information among diverse initiatives regarding Scientific Knowledge Graphs, intended as knowledge bases of scholarly knowledge content (e.g. repositories, databases, catalogues, knowledge graphs, LOD collections). This work is currently conducted in the context of an [RDA Working Group](https://www.rd-alliance.org/groups/scientific-knowledge-graphs-interoperability-framework-skg-if-wg/) and anticipated by the [RDA Open Science Graphs for FAIR Data Interest Group](https://www.rd-alliance.org/groups/open-science-graphs-fair-data-ig/).

All the material related to the framework is available in the repositories of the related GitHub organisation, which are available at https://github.com/skg-if.
