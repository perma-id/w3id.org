# /EXTVARTRANS/
This [W3ID](https://w3id.org) provides a persistent URI namespace for the Extension of the *vartrans* module of OntoLex-Lemon (EXTVARTRANS).

## Uses
EXTVARTRANS is an extension of the Variation and Translation (vartrans) module from OntoLex-Lemon. Two of the three categories from http://purl.org/net/translation-categories# have been soft-reused, and aligned to a new class: CorrespondenceType. This class has sub-classes for semantic and grammatical correspondences. For the former, this includes classification of correspondences where the target of the language pair is a lexical gap.
