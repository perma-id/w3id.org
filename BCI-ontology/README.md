# Brain-Computer Interaction (BCI) Ontology

## What is the BCI-ontology?

The BCI ontology specifies a foundational metadata model set for real-world multimodal Brain-Computer Interaction (BCI) data capture activities.

Its structure depicts a conceptual framework that BCI applications can extend and use in their implementations, to define core concepts that capture a relevant and interoperable metadata vocabulary.

As one of the ontologies ("[concept producers](https://w3c.github.io/sdw/ssn-usage/#usage-ontologies "OGC & W3C, On the usage of the SSN ontology (W3C Document): (3) Usage in ontologies (Producers)")") that reuse [SSN](https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-ssn/ "OGC & W3C, Semantic Sensor Network"), BCI-O was selected as part of the analysis [on the usage of SSN](https://w3c.github.io/sdw/ssn-usage/ "OGC & W3C, On the usage of the SSN ontology (W3C Document)").
