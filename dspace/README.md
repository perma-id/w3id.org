# dspace - Dataspace Protocol

This [W3ID](https://w3id.org) provides a persistent URI namespace for the Dataspace Protocol.

## Uses

The Dataspace Protocol is a set of specifications designed to facilitate interoperable data sharing between entities governed by usage control and based on Web technologies. These specifications define the schemas and protocols required for entities to publish data, negotiate usage agreements, and access data as part of a federation of technical systems termed a dataspace.

It has a similar background as the [idsa](../idsa/) namespace but is not exclusively containing IDSA content, therefore requiring the new location.
