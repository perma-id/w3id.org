Persistent identifiers for the ZorroOntology.
I have created an ontology specification draft page for my ontology, with this URI 
"https://kai-vu.github.io/zorro/ZorroOntologySpec/doc/index-en.html"
I would like to redirect it to more user friendly URI by removing the "index-en.html"

Target: https://kai-vu.github.io/zorro/
