Talkidz Ontology v1.0
 
 ## Overview
The Talkidz Ontology is designed to support the development of applications that
assist speech therapists in diagnosing and treating speech disorders. It was
developed through a participatory approach involving speech therapists, ontology
engineers, and clinical researchers. Its structure was validated through a survey
of domain experts assessing the relevance of key classes and competency questions.
Additionally, we demonstrate a real-world clinical application, showcasing the
ontology’s ability to facilitate epidemiological studies, and support
evidence-based decision-making. By providing a standardized, expert-validated
resource, the Talkidz Ontology aims to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness
of speech therapy practices. It serves as a crucial step toward improving
knowledge sharing and datadriven research in the field of language disorders.
