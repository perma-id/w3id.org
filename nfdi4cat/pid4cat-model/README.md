# pid4cat model

**pid4cat** is a handle-based PID system with a custom API and an underlying LinkML model for PID-related metadata.
It provides persistent identifiers for samples, devices, and more, supporting early-stage research and integration from local RDM systems like ELNs to the central data repository [Repo4Cat](https://repository.nfdi4cat.org/).
w3id.org is used to provide permanent URIs for the elements in the metadata model.
