Digital Construction
===

An ontology suite for digital construction. The purpose is to provide the representation mechanisms for construction and
renovation projects that use digital technologies such as BIM modeling, construction management systems, sensor-based
monitoring, scanning and photogrammetry, mobile devices on site, and so on.  The efficient utilization of digital
technologies requires that ability to link the objects of design, measurement and control with activities in
projects.

Contributing projects:
* Diction - The creation of shared situational awareness of construction projects.
* BIM4EEB - BIM-based toolkit for efficient renovation of residential buildings.
