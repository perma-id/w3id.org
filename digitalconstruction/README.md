Digital Construction
===

Digital construction ontologies created in the DiCtion project.  DiCtion aims at the creation of shared situational awareness of construction projects. There are needs to represent information about the building objects (as well as information objects related to it), construction planning and workflows, construction organization, and monitoring data.

The ontologies have been specified by Aalto University, VTT and VisuaLynk Ltd (Finland).
