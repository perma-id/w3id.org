Digital Construction Ontologies
===

An ontology suite for the construction domain. The objective is to provide the representation
mechanisms for built assets and for construction and renovation projects that use digital
technologies such as BIM modeling, construction management systems, sensor-based monitoring,
scanning and photogrammetry, or mobile devices.  The efficient utilization of digital technologies
requires that ability to link the objects of design, measurement and control with activities in
projects.

Digital Construction Ontologies have been defined in the BIM4EEB project (BIM-based toolkit for
efficient renovation of residential buildings, funded by H2020 grant 820660, 2019-2022), building
upon the modeling work started in the Diction project (Development of shared situational awareness
in construction projects, funded by Business Finland 2018-2020).
