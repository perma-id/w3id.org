# Profile
This `/profile/` path segment within `w3id.org` is used for creating persistent URIs for *profiles*.

A *profile* is:

> A specification that constrains, extends, combines, or provides guidance or explanation about the usage of other data specifications.

> This definition includes what are sometimes called "application profiles", "metadata application profiles", or "metadata profiles".
- *defintion from the [W3C's Profiles Vocabulary](https://w3c.github.io/dxwg/prof/)*

Resolving this URI at it's 'slash' location, i.e. <https://w3id.org/profile/> will list all the *profiles* registered within this namespace.

## Expected Use
This persistent URI namespace has been created to support users of both the [W3C's Profiles Vocabulary](https://w3c.github.io/dxwg/prof/) and also the [W3C's Content Negotiation by Profile](https://w3c.github.io/dxwg/conneg-by-ap/) and the related [IETF's Indicating and Negotiating Profiles in HTTP](https://profilenegotiation.github.io/I-D-Profile-Negotiation/I-D-Profile-Negotiation), all of which require URIs for profiles.
