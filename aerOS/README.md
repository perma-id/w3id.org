# aerOS Ontologies

[aerOS](https://aeros-project.eu) is a European research project (Horizon Europe CL4-2021-DATA-01-05) running for 3 years which aims at transparently utilising the resources on the edge-to-cloud computing continuum for enabling applications in an effective manner while incorporating multiple services. The overarching goal of aerOS is to design and build a virtualized, platform-agnostic meta operating system for the IoT edge-cloud continuum.

This folder contains the following ontologies that have been developed in the aerOS project:
