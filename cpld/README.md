# /cpld/

This W3ID provides a persistent URI namespace for the Content Profiles / Linked Documents (CP/LD) standard. CP/LD is intended to be a new National Information Standards Organization(NISO) standard for representing scholarly publications as HTML and JSON-LD.

This standard will be published on the [NISO Website](https://niso.org)

# Uses
The CP/LD namespace is <https://w3id.org/cpld/> and redirects to <https://github.com/niso-standards/cpld/raw/main/schema/cpld.schema.jsonld>, which hosts the CP/LD JSON-LD context and ontology.

Note that this is currently a private GitHub repository which will be opened for read access once the standard has been approved. It is expected that this namespace will be expanded to cover more finegrained redirects to additional resources.
