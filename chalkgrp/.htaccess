# The cookbook itself
# -------------------
# The identifier https://w3id.org/chalkgrp is for the cookbook itself:
#
RewriteRule ^$   https://stuchalk.domains.unf.edu/ [R=303,L]
#
# Catch https://w3id.org/chalkgrp/ and remove the slash; the slashed version shall not have meaning
RewriteRule ^/$   https://w3id.org/chalkgrp [R=301,L]


# Identifiers
# ------------------
# In the following block: define individual identifiers for recipes, of the form https://w3id.org/chalkgrp/CRGxxx
# The order is arbitrary and does not have meaning.
# Structure them in blocks of 10 (i.e. [000...009], [010...020], ...) for better human-readability.
# If an identifier becomes obsolete, move them to the very bottom, there is a separate block for this purpose.

# Obsolete Identifiers
# --------------------
# Obsolete Identifiers have been minted once, and are gone now.
# Best-practice handling to communicate this and around this fact is not specified yet.
# We redirect to a page explaining what happened to inform the user.
#

# Other identifiers
# --------------------
# Those identifiers are not strictly related to the Chalk Research Group, but are in the friends zone.
#

# Requests to resources that are not defined
# ------------------------------------------
# Catch identifiers not yet caught until here, and redirect the user to a custom 404 page to explain this fact:
