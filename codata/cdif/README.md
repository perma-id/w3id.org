# CDIF-- Cross Domain Interoperability framework

CDIF is a set of implementation recommendations, based on domain-neutral metadata standards aligned to support core data documentation functions required by FAIR. This repository is used to resolve identifiers for various artificts used in the implementation of the framework, including profiles for metadata components and SHACL rules to validate instance documents.
