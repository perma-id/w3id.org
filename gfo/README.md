# General Formal Ontology (GFO)

The General Formal Ontology is a top-level ontology for conceptual modelling. It includes elaborations of categories like objects,
processes, time and space, properties, relations, roles, functions, facts, and situations.

The ontology is divided into modules, which have their own namespaces (e.g., https://w3id.org/gfo/time for the **time** module).
https://w3id.org/gfo imports all modules and does not itself contain any classes or properties.
