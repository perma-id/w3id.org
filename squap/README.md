# SQuAP

The SQuAP model (Software Quality, Architecture, Process) describes twenty- eight main factors that impact on software quality in banking systems, and each factor is described as a relation among some characteristics from the three ISO standards. Hence, SQuAP makes such relations emerge rig- orously, although informally. SQaAP-Ont is an OWL ontology that formalises those relations in order to represent and reason via linked data about software engineering in a three-dimensional model consisting of quality, architecture, and process characteristics.
