## Usecase


**Use case 1**. SEO is in use by [EVENTSKG](http://kddste.sda.tech/EVENTSKG-Dataset/EVENTSKG_R2.html), 	A dataset of scientific events, containing historical data about the publications, submissions, start date, end date, location and homepage for top-prestigious events series.

**Use case 2**. OR-SEO is in use on +6,800 event pages on  [OpenResearch](https://www.openresearch.org/wiki/Main_Page), which facilitates the  creation of events instances, i.e., event series wiki-pages, without going into the details of the implementation of the ontology.
