# Companion Planting Ontology

## Introduction
This repository contains the Companion Planting Ontology, a resource developed by the [Knowledge in AI](https://kai.cs.vu.nl/) group of Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, for the purpose of understanding and implementing companion planting strategies in agriculture. Companion planting is the practice of growing certain plants in proximity for pest control, pollination, providing habitat for beneficial creatures, maximizing use of space, and to otherwise increase crop productivity.

## Purpose of the Ontology
- **Enhancing Agricultural Knowledge**: To provide a structured and detailed knowledge base about companion planting.
- **Facilitating Decision Making**: To assist gardeners and farmers in making informed decisions about plant pairings.
- **Promoting Biodiversity**: To encourage biodiversity in gardens and farms through informed plant choices.
- **Optimizing Plant Health and Yield**: To help in selecting plant combinations that improve growth and yield.
- **Pest Management**: To offer natural alternatives for pest control through strategic plant placement.
- **Educational Tool**: To serve as an educational resource for students and enthusiasts in agriculture and gardening.

## Competency Questions
The ontology is designed to answer key questions that aid in understanding and applying companion planting principles effectively. Some of these questions include:

- What plants are beneficial to grow together for pest control?
- Which plant combinations should be avoided in a garden or farm setting?
- What are the best companion plants for a specific crop (e.g., tomatoes)?
- How can companion planting be used to combat specific pests (e.g., aphids)?

Feel free to explore the ontology and contribute to its development. Your insights and feedback are valuable in enhancing this knowledge base.
