# Event Venue Registry

This [W3ID](https://w3id.org) provides persistent URLs for entities and artifacts in
the [Event Venue Registry (EVR)](https://github.com/event-venue-registry/evr), a database
and ontology cataloging and characterizing physical venues at which events (such as conferences)
can take place.

## Vocabulary

Currently, the EVR auto-generates a site on GitHub. The identifier (`0000001`) representing
the Cultural Center Altinate/San Gaetano in Padova, Italy can be found on the auto-generated
site here: https://event-venue-registry.github.io/evr/0000001/

The `.htaccess` file in this directory enables the construction of a PURL for this entity
like https://w3id.org/evr/venue/0000001.

## Ontology Artifacts

There are OWL and OBO ontology artifacts generated that can be accessed at:

- https://w3id.org/evr/ontology/evr.owl
- https://w3id.org/evr/ontology/evr.obo
