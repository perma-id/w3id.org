Demonstration of a Customizable Representation Model for 
Graph-Based Visualizations of Ontologies â€“ GizMO

Abstract: Visualizations can facilitate the development, exploration, communication,
and sense-making of ontologies. Suitable visualizations, however, are highly dependent
on individual use cases and targeted user groups. In this demo, we present a methodology 
that enables customizable definitions for ontology visualizations. 
We showcase its applicability by introducing GizMO, a representation model for
graph-based visualizations in the form of node-link diagrams. 
Additionally, we present two applications that operate on the 
GizMO representation model and enable individual customizations for ontology visualizations.
