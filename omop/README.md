OMOP Common Data Model
=======

A w3id URI to resolve OMOP Common Data Model concepts.

The OMOP Common Data Model allows for the systematic analysis of  disparate observational databases. The concept behind this approach is  to transform data contained within those databases into a common format  (data model) as well as a common representation (terminologies,  vocabularies, coding schemes), and then perform systematic analyses  using a library of standard analytic routines that have been written  based on the common format.
