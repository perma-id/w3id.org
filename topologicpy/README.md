## Ontology Overview
The TopologicPy 3D Spatial Modeling Ontology is designed to facilitate the detailed representation and manipulation of 3D models through non-manifold BREP (Boundary Representation) structures. Its primary purpose is to provide a comprehensive and structured framework for defining the topology of 3D models, encompassing various elements such as vertices, edges, wires, faces, shells, cells, cell complexes, and clusters. The ontology is heavily inspired by the BOT ontology (https://w3c-lbd-cg.github.io/bot/) and there are plans in the near future to add alignments with BOT. The ontology addresses the domain of computational geometry and spatial modeling, specifically targeting applications in CAD (Computer-Aided Design), BIM (Building Information Modeling), and other 3D modeling environments. By standardizing the representation of complex topological relationships, this ontology aims to enhance interoperability, data exchange, and the accuracy of 3D spatial analysis and visualization.
