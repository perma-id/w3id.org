BioCompute standardized bioinformatics pipelines/workflows in the High-Throughput Sequencing (HTS) space. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and George Washington University (GW) have partnered to establish a framework for community-based standards development and harmonization of HTS computations and data formats. Standardized HTS data processing and data formats will promote interoperability and simplify the verification of bioinformatics protocols.
