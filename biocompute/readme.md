The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and George Washington University (GW) have partnered to establish a framework for community-based standards development and harmonization of HTS computations and data formats. Standardized HTS data processing and data formats will promote interoperability and simplify the verification of bioinformatics protocols. To do this, a schema has been developed to represent instances of computational analysis as a BCO. A BCO includes: 

* Information about parameters and versions of the executable programs in a pipeline
* Reference to input and output test data for verification of the pipeline
* A usability domain
* Keywords
* A list of agents involved along with other important metadata, such as their specific contribution

Knowledge of input data is intended to be captured according to existing efforts, including [MIRAGE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_Information_Required_About_a_Glycomics_Experiment), [MIAPE](http://www.psidev.info/miape), and [STRENDA](https://www.beilstein-strenda-db.org/strenda/public/guidelines.xhtml), and to be in accordance with Minimum Information Standards. In addition to all the information captured in the BCO, the BCO itself must be independent of the execution environment, whether it is a local high-performance or a cloud-based infrastructure.
To facilitate a means for different stakeholders in the HTS communities to provide input on the BioCompute standard we follow the [Open-Stand.org principles for collaborative open standards development](https://open-stand.org/about-us/principles/).
