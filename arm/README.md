# Art and Rare Materials (ARM) BIBFRAME Ontology Extensions

The [Art and Rare Materials (ARM) BIBFRAME Ontology Extensions](https://github.com/Art-and-Rare-Materials-BF-Ext/arm) are now developed under the auspices of the Art Libraries Society of North America’s Cataloging Advisory Committee, the Association of College and Research Library’s Rare Books and Manuscript Section’s Bibliographic Committee and the Society of American Archivists’ Standards Committee.

The initial [Art and Rare Materials Ontology Extensions v0.1](https://github.com/LD4P/arm) ontology extensions to [BIBFRAME](https://www.loc.gov/bibframe/) were developed as part of the [Linked Data for Production](http://ld4p.org/) (LD4P) project. With support from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, the LD4P partners (Columbia, Cornell, Harvard, Library of Congress, Princeton, and Stanford) are piloting the production of linked data for library resources.
