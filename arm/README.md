# Art and Rare Materials Ontology Extensions to BIBFRAME

The [Art and Rare Materials Ontology Extensions](https://github.com/LD4P/ArtFrame-RareMat) ontology extensions to [BIBFRAME](https://www.loc.gov/bibframe/) are part of the [Linked Data for Production](http://ld4p.org/) (LD4P) project. With support from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, the LD4P partners (Columbia, Cornell, Harvard, Library of Congress, Princeton, and Stanford) are piloting the production of linked data for library resources.
