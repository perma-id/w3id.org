# Characterisation Methodology Domain Ontology (CHAMEO)
An ontology for materials characterization based on the [CHADA](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S235249281930087X?via%3Dihub) template.

This ontology development is supported by an [EMMC Task Group](https://emmc.eu/focus-areas/interoperability/tg2-5/). The corresponding forum can be found [here](https://emmc.eu/forum?view=topic&id=154).

## Requirements

The CHAMEO Ontology is built with an alignment with EMMO and some of its modules, as well as with EMMO-compliant domain-level ontologies developed for the Open Innovation Environment (OIE) from the OYSTER project. The following table describes the version compatibility between those ontologies:

| Imported Ontologies | Version           |
| ------------------- | ----------------- |
| EMMO                | 1.0.0-beta5       |
| OIE Manufacturing   |                   |
| OIE Materials       |                   |
| OIE Software        |                   |
| OIE Models          |                   |
