# What is the Aquatic Food Ontology (AQFO)
The Aquatic Food Ontology (AQFO) is currently being developed to enable easy aggregation and analysis of data generated by the CGIAR Initiative on Aquatic Foods. The ontology has been subdivided into two domains - aquaculture and small scale fisheries. The development of AQFO is currently led by WorldFish and supported by the Alliance of Bioversity and CIAT.
