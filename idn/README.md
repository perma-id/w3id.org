# IDN (Indigenous Data Network)
This `/idn/` path segment within `w3id.org` is used for creating persistent IRIs for resources published by Australia's [Indigenous Data Newtork](https://idnau.org/).

All the IRIs matched with patterns within `w3id.org/idn/` are for objects defined within the IDN's multi-part Knowledge Graph.  The main patterns are for catalogued resources' metadata, vocabularies that support their classification and some small ontologies for things like CARE and FAIR scores for data.
