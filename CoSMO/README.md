# CoSMO w3id

This folder provides permanent URLs (w3id) for the CoSMO ontology.

## Purpose

The CoSMO ontology (Consent in Social Media Ontology) is designed to formally represent knowledge about the consent of individuals in digital social media, focusing on data protection. This w3id ensures stable, persistent URLs so the ontology can be reliably referenced in research, ontologies, applications, and tools such as Protégé.

## Permanent URLs

- **Ontology (OWL):** https://w3id.org/CoSMO/ontology → CoSMO.owl  
- **Ontology (Turtle):** https://w3id.org/CoSMO/ontology.ttl → CoSMO.ttl  
- **Documentation / GitHub Pages:** https://w3id.org/CoSMO/doc
