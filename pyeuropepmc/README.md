# pyeuropepmc

Permanent identifier for PyEuropePMC RDF data on w3id.org.

## Description

This w3id.org namespace provides resolvable URIs for RDF data generated by the PyEuropePMC library. PyEuropePMC is a comprehensive Python toolkit for searching, retrieving, and analyzing scientific literature from Europe PMC, supporting advanced features like full-text parsing, enrichment from external APIs, and RDF export.

The URIs under `https://w3id.org/pyeuropepmc/` resolve to RDF triples representing biomedical entities such as papers, authors, institutions, and references, enabling linked data integration and semantic web applications.

## Usage

URIs are constructed as follows:
- Papers: `https://w3id.org/pyeuropepmc/paper/{doi-or-id}`
- Authors: `https://w3id.org/pyeuropepmc/author/{orcid-or-id}`
- Institutions: `https://w3id.org/pyeuropepmc/institution/{ror-or-id}`
- Other entities: `https://w3id.org/pyeuropepmc/{entity-type}/{id}`

These URIs redirect to the corresponding RDF files hosted on GitHub, allowing them to be dereferenced in RDF tools, SPARQL endpoints, and linked data browsers.

## Examples

- Paper by DOI: `https://w3id.org/pyeuropepmc/paper/10.1038/nature11476`
- Author by ORCID: `https://w3id.org/pyeuropepmc/author/0000-0002-1234-5678`
- Fallback ID: `https://w3id.org/pyeuropepmc/paper/pmc3258128`

## Redirection

All requests to `https://w3id.org/pyeuropepmc/*` are redirected (HTTP 302) to the corresponding files in the GitHub repository's raw data: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JonasHeinickeBio/pyeuropepmc/main/data/*`.

This setup ensures that RDF URIs generated by PyEuropePMC are resolvable linked data, supporting content negotiation and semantic web standards.
