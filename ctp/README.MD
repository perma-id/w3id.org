Persistent URIs related to the Cultural Thematic Path (CTP) Ontology, an ontology for the creation and structuring of cultural thematic paths, aimed at supporting the linked data publishing and managing for the fruition of cultural heritage.

The project is developed under the Ph.D. Research Project in Digital Humanities, supported by PON "Ricerca e Innovazione" 2014-2020, Asse IV "Istruzione e ricerca per il recupero", Azione IV.5 "Dottorati su tematiche Green" DM 1061/2021, and is driven by Italian National Research Council - [Istituto di matematica applicata e tecnologie informatiche "Enrico Magenes" (IMATI)](https://www.cnr.it/en/istituto/050/)

===================
We use **https://w3id.org/ctp** for persistent URIs in referring to the ontology and its complementary documentation

We have created:
+  `https://w3id.org/ctp` for actual ontology serialized in different syntaxes and ontology documentation
+  `https://w3id.org/ctp/cq` link to competency questions
+  `https://w3id.org/ctp/equivalences` for equivalences with other schemes

Other links are for specific pieces of documentation.
+ `https://w3id.org/ctp/cq/CQXX` for SPARQL Query corrisponding to CQXX
+ `https://w3id.org/ctp/tabular` for tabular description of entities, attribute, etc
+ `https://w3id.org/ctp/ncf` for the ontology instantiation related to DigitXL - Novum Corpus Fontanianum scenario
+ `https://w3id.org/ctp/santiagodecompostela` for the ontology instantiation related to Cultural Routes - Camino de Santiago de Compostela scenario
