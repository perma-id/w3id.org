# The CoronaVirus Disease Ontology (CovidO)

# What is CovidO?
The CoronaVirus Disease Ontology (CovidO) specifies a foundational metadata model for real-world multimodal CoronaVirus. CovidO provides an Ontological Framework for Representation and annotation of COVID-19 Information. This is an extension of CODO (COviD-19 Ontology) in real-world multimodal dimensions

Its structure depicts a conceptual framework that CoronaVirus Disease (Covid-19) applications can extend and use in their implementations, to define core concepts that capture a relevant and interoperable metadata vocabulary.
