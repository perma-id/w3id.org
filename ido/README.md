# Permanent identifier space for the Imperial Data Ontology

The Imperial Data Ontology (IDO) is an OWL 2 DL ontology that allows the description of selling data of fashion design industries.

The development of IDO is one of the outcomes of the agreement between the [University of Bologna](http://www.unibo.it/en) and [Imperial](http://www.imperialfashion.com/en/). Part of this agreement is dedicated to the use of Semantic Web technologies for the description and analysis of selling data of Imperial, and, more generally, of fashion design industries.

The responsible for this space is Silvio Peroni, who can be contacted via email (essepuntato@gmail.com) and twitter ([@essepuntato](https://twitter.com/essepuntato)).
