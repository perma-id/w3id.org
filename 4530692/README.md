# GeoArchive collection of NI 43-101 Technical Reports (/4530692/)
This W3ID namespace provides persistence to scientific reference assets that we know will need to move to different technologies over time. It is one of a number of collections USGS is setting up as part of a "GeoArchive." We are currently leveraging the Zotero reference manager for metadata/file storage using the web interface as human links for reference strings in reports and articles and the API for machine access in supported formats.

## Uses
This namespace starts with the unique identifier for the Zotero Group Library containing bibliographic metadata and documents for  National Instrument (NI) 43-101 Technical Reports used as scientific references and in need of a persistent citation source.

## Links
