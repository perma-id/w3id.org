# CISE Ontology

## About Common Information Sharing Environment (CISE)

The CISE data model has the ambition to serve as a common European format for sharing information across countries and sectors. It identifies the most useful aspects for maritime monitoring authorities, as they were identified and validated by experts and represented all relevant sectors at EU and national level. The version of the CISE data model used to produce the CISE-OWL ontology is 1.5.3.

While CISE has been adopted as common exchange format and represents the vocabulary of maritime surveillance, each system in maritime coordination and rescue centers may have its own vocabulary and data schemes. A common ontology provides a high-level pivot model that facilitates interoperability and reasoning.
