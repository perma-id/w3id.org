        <h1>AcrossX Vocabulary</h1>
        <p>Description: Innovative and diversified technologies are increasingly available for teaching and learning. But the biggest pain for teachers using several pieces of technology and resources is putting together the workflow and data locked within different applications. The AcrossX solution solves this problem. The teacher can manage the learning plan as one activity, but leverage affordances and advantages from different tools and resources. The xAPI data from different sources are integrated and visualized on her dashboard. The data are also leveraged to add a social layer and a gamification layer to the learning experience. A feedback widget gives real-time feedback to learners to aid, nudge and encourage them. This project is being implemented in Taipei city, Taiwan. All teachers and students, about 350,000 in number, in Taipei city will be using this solution (later other areas might join); the public department is working towards building an ecosystem (from collaboration of public departments, schools, vendors, scholars, and developers) based on xAPI standard and open learning data as Open Data.</p>

<p>This is the controlled vocabulary of xAPI verbs and activities for the Chinese - Taiwan community of practice.  </p>
