**Name of the project:** EarthChem-GEOROC harmonization, part of the [OneGeochemistry initiative](https://onegeochemistry.github.io/)

**Description:** redirects for geochemistry analytical techniques vocabulary.  Version 1.0 vocabulary includes one skos:ConceptScheme with 229 concepts. This concept scheme contains skos concepts for analysis methods used to produce observation results with information about the physical properties, chemical or isotopic composition, crystallography, or molecular structure of material samples. Based on spreadsheet compilation of method vocabularies from GeoX, GeoRock, PetDb and OSIRIS-REx. Definitions added and updated based on web research, and SKOS serialization by S.M. Richard.

Redirects /, /method and /method.html to Australian Research Data Commons, Research Vocabularies Australia landing page for the concept scheme, and /{methodname} to the landing page for the {methodname} concept.
