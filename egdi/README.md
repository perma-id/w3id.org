## About EGDI

The European Geological Data Infrastructure (EGDI) is a collaborative initiative aimed at facilitating the sharing, integration, and accessibility of geological information across Europe. It serves as a comprehensive platform that brings together geological data from various sources, including national geological surveys, research institutions, and other geological organizations.

EGDI focuses on harmonizing geological data standards and promoting interoperability to ensure seamless exchange of information among different stakeholders. By creating a unified framework, it enables geoscientists, policymakers, researchers, and the public to access a wealth of geological data efficiently.
