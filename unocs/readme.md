## Unified Ontology for Construction Safety (UNOCS)

## Description
The Unified Ontology for Construction Safety (UNOCS), is designed to represent knowledge about the domain of construction safety. The ontology is intended to provide a standardized vocabulary for describing concepts, entities, and relationships relevant to (1) hazard and mitigation planning, (2) safety inspection planning and conformance checking, and (3) incident logging in construction. UNOCS provides a framework that facilitates the sharing and reusability of knowledge among stakeholders across various stages of construction projects. By integrating established systems like IFC ifcOWL and DiCon, it ensures interoperability with other domain-specific knowledge systems, making the ontology both novel and comprehensive. By structuring safety knowledge conceptually and integrating it throughout the construction process, UNOCS enables the seamless incorporation of data and information from diverse sources. Furthermore, implemented in a machine-readable format, the ontology eases integration into knowledge management systems or software architectures, enhancing its practical utility.
