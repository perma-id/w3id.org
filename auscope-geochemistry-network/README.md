**AuScope Geochemistry Network (AGN)**

**Description:** The [AuScope Geochemistry Network](https://www.auscope.org.au/agn) is an Australian consortium of Earth Science institutions and scientists collaborating on FAIR geochemistry data infrastructure. This initiative is supported by [NCRIS](https://www.education.gov.au/ncris) and [AuScope](https://www.auscope.org.au/). The AGN is committed to producing and maintaining structured geochemical data schemas for a range of techniques and analytical instrumentation for use in the Earth Science community. These schemas are also implemented to the [EarthBank](https://www.auscope.org.au/earthbank) platform, an AGN project which provides a FAIR community platform for storing, publishing, integrating and sharing geochemical data. EarthBank is available globally either through the online interface or by API connection.
