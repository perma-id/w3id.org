# Tractus-X Trust Namespace

This namespace was used in specification drafts for a protocol for the exchange of verifiable credentials. The project
was soon moved to the EDWG and the [dspace-dcp](../dspace-dcp) namespace. However, there's still systems out there
that use payloads including `tractusx-trust` for compatibility reasons. The namespace is registered mainly to prevent
someone else squatting on it.
