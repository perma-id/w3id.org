# /diga/

This [W3ID](https://w3id.org) provides a persistent URI namespace for a thesaurus and connected resources from the Collaborative Research Center (in German: SFB) 1475 ["Metaphors of Religion"](https://sfb1475.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/en/).

## Uses

The namespace currently only contains the project website and the conceptual thesaurus itself:

* **`/MoRe-SFB1475/`** redirects to the project website
* **`/MoRe-SFB1475/CT/`** is the entry point to the thesaurus
* **`/MoRe-SFB1475/CT/concepts/`** is used for the individual concepts
