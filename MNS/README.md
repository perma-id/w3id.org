About Modelling and Standards Ontology (MnS)
===================
While MnS extends the foundational work of the EC3 BIM Standards Landscape Explorer by enbling the development of an OWL-based representation of the dataset, it also bridges the gap between natural language documentation of standards and machine-readable, queryable representations.

In essence, the MnS ontology reuses other ontologies when possible. The intention was to add value by focusing on the way the data makes sense to practitioners in the built environment had they need to use a BIM standard, not on just making an ontology to make standards metadata machine-readable. Therefore, the mns ontology makes the BIM standards data and metadata findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR). The rationale behind developing an ontology was to (1) enable our existing relational dataset to become a knowledge graph and easily accessible and linked to the existing data on the Web, and (2) enable others to understand and query our data for their progress in using BIM and digital construction standards. 


Motivation
==========
Despite the critical role of standards in the construction industry, their adoption is hindered by accessibility challenges, natural language complexity, and a lack of machine-readable formats. The BIM Landscape Stanadrds Explorer initiative by the M&S committee aimed to address parts of these issues/ BIM Landscape Stanadrds Explorer is connected to a carefully anlysed and curated dataset of BIM stndards and their metadata, shaped through significant over the past couple of years. However, the data was structured in a relational database on the one hand. One  other hand, the data was not machine-readble, not connected to the other datasets and not easily queryable despite being publicly available.
The MnS Ontology aims to:

* Provide a formal, semantic structure for BIM-related standards, although it can be also adapted by other domains.
* Facilitate querying and exploration of (BIM and releted) standards' metadata and relationships.
* Promote interoperability and integration of standards with other datasets.
* Establish a Link between the metadata of standards and the exisitng ontologies in the construction domain.
* In the long-term, MnS ontology aims to bridge the BIM Stnadards Landscape Explorer data and tool with the Built Environment Lookup Service (BE-OLS), which is also dveloped by the M&S committee.
