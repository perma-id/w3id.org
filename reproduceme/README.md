# REPRODUCE-ME: Reproducibility of Scientific Experiments.
REPRODUCE-ME ontology extended from PROV-O and P-Plan is used to represent the whole picture of an experiment describing the path it took from its design to result. The research page explains the works done for the reproducibility of scientific experiments. The work includes the REPRODUCE-ME ontology and ProvBook, an extension of Jupyter Notebook, which captures and displays the provenance of the notebook execution.
