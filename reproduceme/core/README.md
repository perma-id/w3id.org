# ReproduceMeON: ReproduceMe-Core Ontology
The ReproduceMe-Core ontology is the core ontology of the ReproduceMe Ontology Network (ReproduceMeON). The ReproduceMe-Core ontology is designed to provide a detailed abstract definition of structured knowledge for the provenance and reproducibility of scientific studies. It is based on the foundational ontologies: PROV-O and P-Plan. It describes an experiment and its data, agents, activities, plans, steps, variables, instruments, materials and settings required for its reproducibility.
