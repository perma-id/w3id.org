# Neural Electronic Interface Ontology
The Neural Electronic Interface Ontology represents the types of devices used to interface with the central nervous system to enhance (or augment) stimuli from a subject's external environment, the conditions under which these devices should be employed, the assessment of a subject's sensory ability, and the metrics for evaluating the performance.
