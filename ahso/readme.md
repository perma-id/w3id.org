# Animal Health Surveillance Ontology (AHSO)

Animal health data are collected for different primary purposes by different institutions, e.g. clinical data are stored by veterinarians to have history on their patients; laboratory data are recorded mainly to allow proper billing. These data are then used for surveillance secondarily - we build automated systems that try to make sense of these data to detect patterns of diseases in real-time.
 
**_Project Goal_**: To develop an ontology of animal health data which can promote the secondary use of these data for surveillance ([data-driven surveillance](http://datadrivensurveillance.org), or syndromic surveillance). 


## Full Documentation
Visit the **[AHSO open book](https://nandadorea.gitbooks.io/ahso/content/)** for detailed information about the project

## Background information and resources about ontologies
Visit the **[AHSO open book](https://nandadorea.gitbooks.io/ahso/content/)**. This is an open-book initiative, and everyone is welcome to add discussions or suggest materials that can enrich the repository for those of us trying to understand what ontologies are all about and how they can contribute to animal health surveillance. 

## Communication and Involvement
* Submit an issue on GitHub ([Form](https://github.com/SVA-SE/AHSO/issues/new))
