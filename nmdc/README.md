# NMDC redirects

The [redirects](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/howto/htaccess.html) in this directory are managed by members of the [National Microbiome Data Collaborative](https://microbiomedata.org/) (NMDC) team.

The redirects were created with the goal of providing NMDC stakeholders with concide, persistent URLs for NMDC-related resources, such as [NMDC Schema](https://github.com/microbiomedata/nmdc-schema) source code files and term-specific documentation pages.

## Examples
