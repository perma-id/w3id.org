Intended to redirect soemthing like https://w3id/nmdc/nmdc.yaml

to https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microbiomedata/nmdc-schema/main/src/schema/nmdc.yaml

[LinkML](https://linkml.io/) prefix `nmdc` would be expanded to https://w3id/nmdc/

So `nmdc:nmdc.yaml` would also expand/redirect to https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microbiomedata/nmdc-schema/main/src/schema/nmdc.yaml
