# Loc-I for Disaster Recovery (l4dr)
This `/l4dr/` path segment within `w3id.org` is used for creating persistent IRIs for _Linked Data_ system resources for the Loc-I for Disaster Recovery (l4dr) demonstrator project motivated by Australia's [new commitment to disaster recovery data integration systems](https://minister.awe.gov.au/ley/media-releases/australia-commits-climate-resilience). It builds on top of the [Location Index (LocI)](https://www.ga.gov.au/locationindex) research system.

Data for this l4dr system uses persistent identifiers provided by the [Australian Government Linked Data Working Group](https://www.linked.data.gov.au) using the `linked.data.gov.au` persistent ID namespace, however that PID system doesn't provide system IRIs, thus W3ID is used.

## Implementations
The following list of PIDs are implemented within this namespace path segment:

* [/](https://w3id.org/l4dr/) - system splash page
* [/explorer](https://w3id.org/l4dr/explorer) - Linked Data viewer
* [/globe](https://w3id.org/l4dr/globe) - spatial portal
* _... more to come..._
