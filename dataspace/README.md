# The ontology for Data Space

Ever wonder how to write rules for a data space or how to unambiguously identify a data space authority ?

Don't look further and reuse the Data Space ontology, based on the work of the [Data Space Support Center](https://dssc.eu/), augmented with the knowledge and requirements of the data space community.

The starting point of this work is the [glossary of the blueprint version 1.5](https://dssc.eu/space/bv15e/766061530/Introduction+-+DSSC+Glossary).

## Publication

The ontology is published under the <https://w3id.org/dataspace>.
