**Name of the project:** [SituAnnotate: The Annotation Situations Ontology Module](https://github.com/delfimpandiani/situannotate/)

**Description:**
This is the SituAnnotate ontology, an ontological module for Annotation Situations. It is based on using the ontology design pattern Descriptions and Situations (DnS) in a modular way. It allows the representation of any annotation situation in which some meaning is assigned, through linguistic (lexical) units to some annotated entity (an image, a concept, a document, etc.). It allows the representation of the situation within which an annotation is done as well as all related data including the annotated entity, the annotator, the time and place of the annotation, the remuneration scheme underlying the annotation task, and the roles that the annotation may play in the context of the situation. Each annotation situation can be related to multiple annotations, and it satisfies a description that gives meaning to annotation roles. The ontology is furthermore aligned to dul - Dolce Ultralight foundational Ontology.
