# CSRO

Container Security Risk Ontology (CSRO) is an ontology for security risk assessment in containerized environments. Its main purpose is to provide a formal, extensible framework for modeling security assumptions, risk factors, calculation rules, and standards relevant to containers. CSRO supports automated reasoning and risk analysis, bridging the gap between static documentation and dynamic security engineering needs.

This artifact was created with the needs of domain experts, the assurance and security community, and the Semantic Web community in mind.

The ontology has been created by Yannick Landeck, scientific researcher at the fortiss Research Institute of the Free State of Bavaria for software-intensive systems.
