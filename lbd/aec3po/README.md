# Architecture, Engineering and Construction Compliance Checking and Permitting ontology (AEC3PO)

Developed in the context of the EU ACCORD project (Automating the Building Permitting and Compliance Checking), the Architecture, Engineering and Construction Compliance Checking and Permitting ontology (AEC3PO) describes building compliance-related documents and design codes, and automated compliance checking of 3D models of buildings with respect to these documents.

## About the ACCORD project

ACCORD is a Horizon Europe project (2022-2025) that focuses on automating the building permit and compliance processes using BIM and other data sources. ACCORD develops a Semantic Framework that will be demonstrated in five real-life construction projects around Europe: Finland, Estonia, Germany, UK and Spain. The framework includes semantic interoperability, a rule formalisation tool and integrated micro-services for building permit and compliance checking.
