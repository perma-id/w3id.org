# The Murten Panorama Digital Scholarly Edition

The Panorama of the Battle of Murten (Murten Panorama) depicts the moment Swiss Confederates gained the upper hand against the Duchy of Burgundy during its 1476 invasion, a turning point in European history. Commissioned by a Swiss society specialized in public entertainment, the panorama was the main media of the end of the 19th c. The artist, Louis Braun, was a famous painter of German military history. Braun and his team produced this work measuring 10 x 100 m in 1893. It was on display in Zurich, then Geneva (1894-1907), before falling in oblivion behind the new media of the cinema. Rediscovered in 1996, it was restored and put on a brief display for 4 months during Expo.02 (2002) in a monolith built by Jean Nouvel on the Murten lac. Since then, it remained rolled up in a Swiss Army deposit.

The scanning of the Battle of Murten Panorama canvas (For a full description see The [Terapixel Panorama Project](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/emplus/projects/murten-panorama-digital-twin-scanning-project-the-making-of/)) gives rise to a range of interpretation projects from ultra-high resolution streaming online, to highly significant situated experiences of the panorama akin to what the original experience would have been like but with the aid of spectacular software initiated interactive audio visual effects.

The Murten Panorama Digital Scholarly Edition will be key to transmit and deepen engagement with both the exhibitions and the 2026 Burgundian wars commemorations. The digital twin will be displayed at the highest resolution supported by web browsers. The website will feature other content from the exhibition system version such as 3D models, volumetric videos of reenactors, and a 2D video of the installation being experienced live by visitors. The project database will be made available through Linked Open Data related to the digital twin (links and metadata to images and text). It will notably include a selection of primary sources connected to both the history of the panorama and the context of the battle of Murten. This includes all the recently digitized preparatory drawings by Louis Braun and archives related to the production of the panorama, as well as an augmented edition using Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) standards of the collection of primary sources by Ochsenbein (1876). Enabled by semantic web technologies and IIIF manifest, data can now be curated down to the image region level. Additionally, this website will launch a novel annotation tool that will support future storytelling for narrative rich paintings.

## Namespace Usage
Web applications that deal with Linked Data often need to specify and use URLs that are very stable. We utilize w3id.org to ensure that URLs will always be re-directed to a working installation of the Murten Panorama Digital Scholarly Edition.
