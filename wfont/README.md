# WFOnt
The Wind Farm Ontology (wfont) describes wind farms and their components. It is inspired by the SANDIA Report SAND2009-1171 and DAEKIN project outcomes. It reuses the AffectedBy and EEP (Execution-Executor-Procedure) ontology design patterns to discover sensors or actuators that observe or act on a given quality or feature of interest.

# WFOnt funding
This work is supported by the project DAEKIN (KK-2020/00035), funded by the SPRI-Basque Government through the ELKARTEK.
