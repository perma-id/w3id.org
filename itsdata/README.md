# Ontology for Intelligent Transport Systems

## Uses

The Ontology for Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) is an effort to standardize definitions of data used within ITS. The content of the models are developed in an open community on GitHub but are ultimately referenced and standardized in various standards developed by ISO TC 204.

The files are maintained on the [ISO TC 204 GitHub account](https://github.com/ISO-TC204/) in repositories of the form ontology-its-xxxxx, where xxxxx indicates the data topic of interest.
