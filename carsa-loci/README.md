# carsa-loci
This `/carsa-loci/` path segment within `w3id.org` is used for creating persistent IRIs for _Linked Data_ system resources for the [Climate and Resilience Services Australia (CaRSA)](https://minister.awe.gov.au/ley/media-releases/australia-commits-climate-resilience) [Location Index (LocI)](https://www.ga.gov.au/locationindex) demonstrator system.

Data for the CaRSA-LocI system uses persistent identifiers provided by the [Australian Government Linked Data Working Group](https://www.linked.data.gov.au) using the `linked.data.gov.au` persistent ID namespace, however that PID system doesn't provide system IRIs, thus W3ID is used.

## Implementations
The following list of PIDs are implemented within this namespace path segment:

* [/](https://w3id.org/carsa-loci/) - system splash page
* [/catalogue](https://w3id.org/carsa-loci/catalogue) - CaRSA-LocI resource catalogue
* _... more to come..._
