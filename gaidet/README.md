# GAIDeT – Generative AI Delegation Taxonomy

**Permanent identifier: https://w3id.org/gaidet/**

GAIDeT (Generative AI Delegation Taxonomy) is a taxonomy and ontology designed to help researchers transparently disclose which research and writing tasks were delegated to generative AI tools. It complements existing frameworks such as **CRediT (Contributor Roles Taxonomy)** and **CRO (Contributor Role Ontology)** by providing a structured way to represent AI involvement in the research workflow.

The taxonomy is available in several formats:
- **Human-readable YAML** – primary source with bilingual (English/Ukrainian) labels.
- **Machine-readable OWL ontology** – interoperable with CRO and CRediT.
- **Interactive web tool** – [GAIDeT Declaration Generator](https://panbibliotekar.github.io/gaidet-declaration/) for creating ready-to-use disclosure statements.
