# UK Curriculum Ontology (UKCO) Namespace

This permanent [w3id.org](https://w3id.org) namespace provides stable, persistent identifiers for the **UK Curriculum Ontology (UKCO)** and related resources published by **Oak National Academy**.

The namespace is intended to support linked data applications, educational resource discovery, and interoperability across curriculum datasets.

**Namespace:** [https://w3id.org/uk/curriculum/](https://w3id.org/uk/curriculum/)  
**Redirects to:** [https://www.thenational.academy/uk/curriculum/](https://www.thenational.academy/uk/curriculum/)

## Purpose

This namespace provides permanent URIs for:
- Curriculum entities such as subjects, key stages, units, lessons, and concepts.
- Relationships between curriculum elements (e.g., *teaches*, *requires*, *isPartOf*).
- Metadata about educational resources aligned to the National Curriculum.

It ensures that identifiers remain stable even if the underlying data or hosting platform changes.
