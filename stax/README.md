# RDF Stream Taxonomy (RDF-STaX)

[RDF-STaX](https://github.com/RDF-STaX/rdf-stax.github.io) is a taxonomy of RDF stream types. It can be used to describe RDF streams used on the Web, in software tools, or in scientific publications.

## Contents

The .htaccess handles serving the RDF-STaX ontology in various formats and versions. It also handles redirects to the documentation pages.

The docs are hosted on GitHub Pages, and the ontology files are stored as releases on GitHub.
