**Name of the project:** [MUSCO - Multimodal Descriptions of Social Concepts](https://github.com/delfimpandiani/musco/)

**Description:** Automatic Modeling of (Highly Abstract) Social Concepts evoked by Art Images. This project aims to investigate, model, and experiment with how and why social concepts (such as violence, power, peace, or destruction) are modeled and detected by humans and machines in images. It specifically focuses on the detection of social concepts referring to non-physical objects in (visual) art images, as these concepts are powerful tools for visual data management, especially in the Cultural Heritage field (present in resources such Iconclass and Getty Vocabularies). The hypothesis underlying this research is that we can formulate a description of a social concept as a multimodal frame, starting from a set of observations (in this case, image annotations). We believe thaat even with no explicit definition of the concepts, a “common sense” description can be (approximately) derived from observations of their use.
