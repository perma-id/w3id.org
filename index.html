        <h3 id="purpose">Purpose</h3>
        <p>
The purpose of this website is to provide a secure, permanent 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL">URL</a>
re-direction service for Web applications. This service is run by the
<a href="http://www.w3.org/community/perma-id/">W3C Permanent Identifier Community Group</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
Web applications that deal with 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_data">Linked Data</a>
often need to specify and use
URLs that are very stable. They utilize services such as this one to ensure
that applications using their URLs will always be re-directed to a working
website. This website operates like a 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telephone_switchboard">switchboard</a>, 
connecting requests for
information with the true location of the information on the Web. 
The switchboard can be reconfigured to point to a new location if the 
old location stops working.
        </p>
        <h3 id="management">Management</h3>
        <p>
A growing group of organizations have pledged responsibility as a
consortium to ensure the operation of this website.
These organizations are: 
        </p>
        <ul>
<li><a href="http://digitalbazaar.com/">Digital Bazaar</a></li> 
<li><a href="http://3roundstones.com/">3 Round Stones</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.openlinksw.com/">OpenLink Software</a></li> 
<li><a href="http://www.aptest.com/">Applied Testing and Technology</a></li>
<li><a href="http://openspring.net/">Openspring</a></li>
<li><a href="http://bosatsu.net/">Bosatsu Consulting</a></li>
<li><a href="https://surroundaustralia.com">SURROUND Australia</a></li>
        </ul>
        <p>
They are responsible for all administrative
tasks associated with operating the service. The social contract between 
these organizations gives each of them full access to all information required
to maintain and operate the website. The agreement is setup such that 
a number of these companies could fail, lose interest, or become unavailable
for long periods of time without negatively affecting the operation of the
site.
        </p>
        <h4>Joining the Management consortium</h4>
        <p>
To join the management consortium, please make yourself known to the W3ID comminuty via participation in the mailing list (see the <a href="#w3id-community">W3ID Community</a> section below) and then, if you are still keen to join, please submit an Issue to the <a href="https://github.com/perma-id/w3id.org/issues">GitHub Issue Tracker</a> with the title <em>Seeking to join the W3ID Consortium</em> and include your details.        
        </p>
        <h3 id="system-operations">System Operations</h3>
	<p>
This website operates in HTTPS-only mode to ensure end-to-end security. This
means that it may be used for Linked Data applications that require high
levels of security such as those found in the financial, medical, and
public infrastructure sectors.
	</p>
        <p>
All identifiers associated with this website are intended to be around
for as long as the Web is around. This means decades, if not centuries.
If the final destination for popular identifiers used by this service fail
in such a way as to be a major inconvenience or danger to the Web, the
community will mirror the information for the popular identifier and setup
a working redirect to restore service to the rest of the Web.
        </p>
        <h2 id="new">Creating a New Identifier</h2>
        <p>
If you would like to add or update a permanent identifier of the form
<code>https://w3id.org/...</code>, the preferred procedure is to perform the
following steps:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li><em>Fork</em> <a href="https://github.com/perma-id/w3id.org">the <em>Repository</em> for this system</a> on Github.</li>
          <li>Add or update a new redirect entry and commit your changes.</li>
          <li>Submit a <em>Pull Request</em> for your changes.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
The maintainers of this system will then act on that <em>Pull Request</em> and
merge it into this system's content. You will then be able to see your changes
in the repository and via resolution of the identifier you created or edited.
        </p>
        <p>
If the terms <em>Fork</em> and <em>Pull Request</em> are new to you, you need
to familiarize yourself with the <a href="https://git-scm.com/">Git</a> version
control system and <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a>, the platform used
to host this system.  Please see this documentation:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="https://docs.github.com/en/github-ae@latest/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo">Forking a Repository</a></li>
          <li><a href="https://docs.github.com/en/github-ae@latest/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork">Creating a Pull Request across Forks</a></li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Suitable PR content</h4>
        <p>
Please help out the maintainers of the service with the following in your Pull Requests:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>contact info</strong> in a README.md or .htaccess comment.
            <ul>
              <li>See this example of a good README file: <a href="https://github.com/perma-id/w3id.org/tree/master/dggs">w3id.org/dggs/ README</a></li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><strong>test your changes</strong> with a local checkout of the site.</li>
          <li>
            <strong><em>Squash</em> multiple commits</strong> into one commit before a pull request if appropriate.
            <ul>
              <li>here is information on <em>squashing</em> commits: <a href="https://www.git-tower.com/learn/git/faq/git-squash/">How to Squash Commits in Git</a></li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><strong>use descriptive commit messages</strong>. 
            In particular, include your project name in the commit message.
            For those using the GitHub interface, please modify the default
            "Create/Update/Delete .htaccess" message.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
You can also send a request to add a redirect to the 
<a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-perma-id/">public-perma-id@w3.org</a>
mailing list. Make sure to include the URL that you want on w3id.org, the
URL that you want to redirect to, and the HTTP code that you want to use
when redirecting. An administrator will then create the redirect for you.
        </p>
        <h4>Link checking</h4>
        <p>
A simple <a herf="https://travis-ci.org/perma-id/w3id.org">Travis-CI</a> job
(see <a href="https://github.com/perma-id/w3id.org/blob/master/.travis.yml">.travis.yml</a>) will extract all https://w3id.org/
URIs from <code>*/README.md</code> and check them with
<code><a href="https://wummel.github.io/linkchecker/">linkchecker</a></code>.
In theory, this will catch two kinds of errors:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Following a redirection gives a <code>404 Not Found</code></li>
          <li>An error in <code>.htaccess</code> causes a <code>500 Server Error</code>.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
Note that this only checks URIs that are listed in the `README.md` files.
        </p>
        <p>
Travis might comment on your Pull Request if this test reveals an error.
Check its output logs to ensure the errors are not caused by
your modification.        
        </p>
        <h3 id="naming-policy">Naming Policy</h3>
        <p>
There is no official policy on identifier names. The current practice
is to claim a top-level directory name and add project specific second level
identifiers. For instance, <code>https://w3id.org/PROJECT-ID/SUB-ID...</code>.
Shared top-levels are also available such as
<code>https://w3id.org/people/PERSON-ID</code>. There is no official
list or policy for reserved identifiers. However, the administrators may deny
requests for identifiers that are too generic, could cause confusion, are
inappropriate or offensive, or otherwise may be needed for future service
expansion.
