# /related-to/
This [W3ID](https://w3id.org) provides a persistent URI namespace for entities that are somehow related to other entities; currently, those entities with a DOI.

## Uses
Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs) are a great class of persistent identifiers. However, they stay usually in the sphere of control of the DOI granting agency. This is, the individual author of the content is usually not in control of appending information to the DOIs or create related identifiers.

This namespace thus provides a work-around to link information somehow to DOIs, by creating subdirectories according to the DOIs. The individual subdirectory is intended to be controlled by the authors of the content which is identified by the corresponding DOI.


## Pool of maintainers of this namespace
Each subdirectory will have their own maintainers, mentioned in the corresponding README.md. For the global directory it is currently only:

## Change policy in this namespace
No official change policy in place (yet). We are trying to be sensible, though.
