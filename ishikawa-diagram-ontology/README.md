# /ishikawa-diagram-ontology/

This permanent w3id [`https://w3id.org/ishikawa-diagram-ontology/`](https://w3id.org/ishikawa-diagram-ontology/) redirects to the Ishikawa diagram ontology.

The Ishikawa diagram ontology addresses the domain of Ishikawa diagrams which are one of the major tools for Root Cause Analysis (RCA) besides FMEA and Fault Tree Analysis. Ishikawa diagrams are also known as fishbone or cause and effect diagrams (CED). Ishikawa diagrams result from (iterative) workshops and are commonly stored as images which leads to ambiguous interpretations and a lack of machine-readability. Thus, the ontology contains the relevant concepts to describe Ishikawa diagrams as visual artifacts, their encoded data model, and the process the diagrams resulted from according to best practices.
