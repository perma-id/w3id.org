<h2>The Under-represented Writers project</h2>
<p>The issue of non-European voices lack of representation has been introduced, and studies since the Eighties by many scholars. However, still today the post-colonial point of view(s) is not taken into account in crucial sector of society, such as schools, and it is minority even in projects that claim to be democratic and encyclopedic. This has an impact on how public debate is shaped, because people are not educated to deal with non-Western perspectives, and even the mainstreaming policies adopted by media players are far from being resolutive. As a consequence, the proliferation of toxic speech, and ethnic violence is still high, despite the efforts from many institutions to reduce them.<p>
<p>The Under-Represented Writers (URW) project is aimed at challenging this issue by systematically collecting, and organizing narratives from authors that are often unheard due to their place of birth or their legal status. In this paper we present the first output of this initiative: the URW Knowledge Graph, a dataset of under-represented authors biographies which have been automatically encoded into all the legal status they experienced. The KG is a crucial step for the whole project, since it allows to link the under-represented writers literary production to different periods of their lives, and so to thematically organize narratives.<p>
<h2>The Under-Represented Writers Ontology</h2>
<p>The Ontology of Under-represented Writers (URW) is an attempt to provide a formal, and objective description of authors who potentially suffer a lack of prominence due to the context where they was born. In particular, the aim of URW is to highlight the biographical events, and situations during which a writer may has been experienced the condition of being a subaltern.<p> 
With these goals in mind, we designed the URW Ontology to answer the following Competency Questions: 
<ul>
<li> What people, born in a former colony country, wrote at least one literary work while they were in this condition?</li>
<li> What are the writers who were migrants in a specific country?</li>
<li> What people wrote at least one literary work after they left their home country for a specific reason?</li>
<li> Which authors wrote at least one literary work and are at the same time second generation migrants?</li>
</ul>
<h2>The Under-represented Writers dataset</h2>
<p>A first version of the dataset has been published on <a href="https://datahub.io/marcoantonio.stranisci/underrepresentedkg-green-grasshopper-19">Data Hub</a><p>
<p>The dataset contains 11,216 TimeIndexedPersonStatus, and Migration items about 2,218 authors biographies</p>
