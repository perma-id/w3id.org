# Virtual Human-building Interaction Experiment Ontology (VHBIEO)

The authors develop the Virtual Human-Building Interaction Experiment Ontology (VHBIEO) to support the formalization of virtual human-building interaction experiments. It describes concepts and their relationships related to scientific experiments on human-building interactions using VR technologies. To construct VHBIEO, the authors extend VHBIEO to an ontology of scientific experiments (EXPO) at the domain level, and reused concepts from existing ontologies and semantic models. Additionally, many important terms and their conceptual definition were newly introduced in VHBIEO. The DOGMA approach was applied to establish a structure of VHBIEO. Resource Description Framework (RDF) allowed expression of machine-readable information VHBIEO as set of three elements (i.e., triples). Web Ontology Language (OWL) was used along with information written in RDF to enable defining classes, properties, individuals, and data values of VHBIEO.
