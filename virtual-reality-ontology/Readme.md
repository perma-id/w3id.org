 [OnBehaVR](https://github.com/italojsoliveira/virtual-reality-ontology) is a core ontology that aims to provide a characterization of the user behaviour in a virtual reality environment by leveraging the Unified Foundational Ontology (UFO) and OntoUML modelling language. OnBehaVR intends to structure domain information so that data from different sources can be explained and, therefore, represented and integrated.
