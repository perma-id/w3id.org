# Welcome to the LIT (the Linked Data Integration Toolkit)

Finally - a truly Enterprise-grade, Production-ready developer toolkit for Linked Data!

The LIT is a collection of Enterprise-grade, Production-ready, fully tested developer libraries
(written in TypeScript) specifically designed to make working with Linked Data (i.e., RDF) easier
and more intuitive for developers.

### Authors/Maintainers: 

- Pat McBennett (Email: pat.mcbennett@gmail.com, GitHub: https://github.com/pmcb55)

> [!NOTE]
> The LIT is currently private, but the intention is to make it freely available (probably under
MIT license, and probably on GitHub) once polished and considered feature complete enough for
Enterprise development.
