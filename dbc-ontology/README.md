# DBC Ontology

This identifier is for the DBC Ontology, an OWL ontology for modeling
Controller Area Network (CAN) bus communication systems.

The ontology extends the W3C SSN/SOSA standards to formally represent
CAN messages, signals, ECUs, encoding schemas, and data logging processes.
It supports semantic decoding, integration, and analysis of raw CAN bus data
in automotive, maritime, and related cyber-physical systems.

The ontology is developed as part of the CANDI framework for ontology-based
data access (OBDA), runtime CAN bus decoding, and real-time analytics.
