# RESONANCE Ontology Namespace

This folder defines the persistent identifiers (PIDs) for the RESONANCE ontology suite.  
The namespace is managed under **https://w3id.org/resonance/**.

The w3id redirects provide long-term, stable IRIs for referencing the RESONANCE semantic models used to describe Smart Readiness Indicators (SRI) in buildings, photovoltaic systems, electric vehicles, weather data, and building characteristics.

## Ontologies

The following ontologies are part of the namespace and are redirected to their corresponding `.ttl` files in the official GitHub repository:

- **SRI4ALL** — Core SRI ontology  
  `https://w3id.org/resonance/SRI4ALL`
- **SRI4PV** — Photovoltaic domain ontology  
  `https://w3id.org/resonance/SRI4PV`
- **SRI4EV** — Electric vehicle domain ontology  
  `https://w3id.org/resonance/SRI4EV`
- **SRI4Weather** — Weather and environmental data ontology  
  `https://w3id.org/resonance/SRI4Weather`
- **SRI4Building** — Building-level characteristics ontology
