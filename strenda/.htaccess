# The STRENDA namespace in w3id.org
# -------------------
# The identifier https://w3id.org/strenda is for information about the namespace itself:
#
RewriteRule ^$   https://github.com/perma-id/w3id.org/tree/master/strenda/README.md [R=303,L]
#
# Catch https://w3id.org/strenda/ and remove the slash; the slashed version shall not have meaning
RewriteRule ^\/$   https://w3id.org/strenda [R=301,L]


# Identifiers
# ------------------
# In the following block: individual identifiers are defined of the form https://w3id.org/strenda/xxx
# where the xxx is derived from the start of the lines with "RewriteRule ^xxx$". The part next to
# it is where the identifiers currently links to.
# If an identifier becomes obsolete, move them to the very bottom, there is a separate block for this purpose.

RewriteRule ^biocatalysis-guidelines$ https://github.com/Strenda-biocatalysis/Strenda-biocatalysis [R=303,L,QSA]


# Obsolete Identifiers
# --------------------
# Obsolete Identifiers have been minted once, and are gone now.

#

# RewriteRule "^obsolete-identifier$" "-" [R=410,L]


# Requests to resources that are not defined
# ------------------------------------------
# With the following block you can catch identifiers not yet caught until here,
# and redirect the user to a custom 404 page to explain this fact:
