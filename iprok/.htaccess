# --- Rule for the base PURL (e.g., https://w3id.org/iprok/) ---
# This redirects requests for the base PURL of the ontology to its main HTML documentation.
# R=308: Permanent Redirect, indicating the resource itself (the ontology's conceptual URI)
#        can be found at the target URL for human consumption.
# L: Last rule; if this rule matches, no further rules are processed.
RewriteRule ^/?$ https://konevenkatesh.github.io/IprokDoc/main.html [R=308,L]


# --- Rules for versioned PURLs (e.g., https://w3id.org/iprok/1.0/) ---
# These rules handle content negotiation for requests that include a version number.
# The version pattern ([0-9]+\.[0-9]+(?:\.[0-9]+)?) captures versions like "1.0", "2.1", "1.0.3".
# The captured version is available as $1.
#
# IMPORTANT NOTE ON TARGET URLs AND VERSIONING:
# The target GitHub URLs in the rules below (e.g., .../IprokDoc/iprok.owl) currently DO NOT
# use the captured version $1 in their path. This means that any version specified in the
# PURL (e.g., /iprok/1.0/, /iprok/1.1/) will redirect to the SAME "latest" files located
# directly under your /IprokDoc/ directory on GitHub Pages.
#
# If you later implement version-specific directories on your GitHub Pages site
# (e.g., https://konevenkatesh.github.io/IprokDoc/1.0/iprok.owl),
# YOU MUST UPDATE these target URLs to include $1. For example:
# https://konevenkatesh.github.io/IprokDoc/$1/iprok.owl
#
# R=303: See Other. This is the appropriate redirect code for providing a specific
#        representation of a resource (the ontology version) based on content negotiation.
# NE: No Escape. Prevents Apache from escaping special characters in the redirect URL.
# L: Last rule.
