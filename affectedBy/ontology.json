The constraint on the property seas:derivesFrom to be symmetric is unnecessary and sometimes innapropriate. For instance, the temperature of a room may derive from the occupancy of the room; however, it is not necessary that the occupancy derives from the temperature of the room. A new property aff:affectedBy (released from the symmetric constraint) is defined in the AffectedBy ODP to replace the role of the property seas:derivesFrom. It can be asserted that seas:derivesFrom is sub property of aff:affectedBy. The class aff:FeatureOfInterest is equivalent to seas:FeatureOfInterest, and the class  seas:Property is sub class of aff:Quality. Moreover, seas:hasProperty is sub property of aff:hasQuality, and seas:isPropertyOf is sub property of aff:belongsTo. Furthermore, aff:belongsTo is defined to be functional, to support the notion that a quality is intrinsic to the feature of interest (i.e., an entity) to which it belongs (according to the conceptualization in DUL); and it is asserted that every quality belongs to a feature of interest (aff:Quality rdfs:subClassOf aff:belongsTo som aff:FeatureOfInterest). \n\nFinally, the object chain axiom aff:hasQuality o aff:affectedBy rdfs:subPropertyOf aff:hasQuality is asserted."}],"http://purl.org/dc/terms/modified":[{"@value":"2018-07-05"}],"http://purl.org/dc/terms/title":[{"@language":"en","@value":"AffectedBy ODP"}],"http://purl.org/vocab/vann/preferredNamespacePrefix":[{"@value":"aff"}],"http://purl.org/vocab/vann/preferredNamespaceUri":[{"@id":"https://w3id.org/affectedBy/"}],"http://www.ontologydesignpatterns.org/schemas/cpannotationschema.owl#coversRequirements":[{"@language":"en","@value":"(CQ1).
