    "description" : {
      "en" : "The AffectedBy ODP consists of two classes aff:FeatureOfInterest and aff:Quality; and three properties aff:hasQuality, aff:belongsTo, and aff:affectedBy. \n\nThis ODP is a reengineering of the SEAS Feature of Interest ontology (https://ci.mines-stetienne.fr/seas/FeatureOfInterestOntology-1.0). The constraint on the property seas:derivesFrom to be symmetric is unnecessary and sometimes innapropriate. For instance, the temperature of a room may derive from the occupancy of the room; however, it is not necessary that the occupancy derives from the temperature of the room. A new property aff:affectedBy (released from the symmetric constraint) is defined in the AffectedBy ODP to replace the role of the property seas:derivesFrom. It can be asserted that seas:derivesFrom is sub property of aff:affectedBy. The class aff:FeatureOfInterest is equivalent to seas:FeatureOfInterest, and the class  seas:Property is sub class of aff:Quality. Moreover, seas:hasProperty is sub property of aff:hasQuality, and seas:isPropertyOf is sub property of aff:belongsTo. Furthermore, aff:belongsTo is defined to be functional, to support the notion that a quality is intrinsic to the feature of interest (i.e., an entity) to which it belongs (according to the conceptualization in DUL); and it is asserted that every quality belongs to a feature of interest (aff:Quality rdfs:subClassOf aff:belongsTo som aff:FeatureOfInterest). \n\nFinally, the object chain axiom aff:hasQuality o aff:affectedBy rdfs:subPropertyOf aff:hasQuality is asserted."
