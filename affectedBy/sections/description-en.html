<p>This section shows the specification of the AffectedBy ODP requirements in the form of Competency Questions:</p>

<ul>
<li>CQ1: What are the properties/qualities of a feature of interest?</li>
<li>CQ2: What are the properties/qualities that affect a given property of a
feature of interest?</li>
<li>CQ3: Which feature of interest does a given property/quality belongs to?</li>
</ul>

<h3>Instantiating the AffectedBy ODP <span class="backlink"> back to <a href="#toc">ToC</a></span></h3>

<p>This section shows an example of instantiating the AffectedBy ODP. Let us consider the LR03 lecture room as a feature of interest: a lecture room located on the ground floor of a building, and with a large window that overlooks the road that passes near the building. Some properties of LR03 are: the area of the lecture room, the number of seats available or the quality of comfort at any given time. The quality of comfort in this lecture room is affected by the room temperature and the nearby outdoor noise. In turn, the temperature of LR03 is affected by the number of people present in the lecture room, the humidity of the lecture room, and the intensity of solar radiation received through the room window. Regarding the impact of outdoor noise, it is affected by the sound insulation factor of the room. Lastly, the received solar radiation is affected by the azimuth (i.e. orientation) of the lecture room window. Figure 2 represents this example (For the sake of simplicity, the <i>rdf:type</i> relationships are not shown)</p>
