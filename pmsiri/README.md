# Pollinator metadata standard [pmsiri]
## An ontology for pollinator related data maintained by Bee-life under the guidance of EFSA.

The EU Pollinator Hub Metadata Standard (EUPH-MS) is used to describe data elements that are part of the datasets stored in the EUPH. The conceptual model is based on the principles of the Darwin Core (DwC) metadata standard. It includes metadata standard elements which are considered relevant for pollinator related data and are not part of the Darwin Core metadata standard. These include the standard elements developed and maintained by the Apimondia Working Group 15 (Standardization of data on bees and beekeeping), known as the Pollinator Metadata Standard (PMS), as well as existing standards from international, supranational and national standardisation organisations such as ISO, UNSD, FAOSTAT, and the European Union, in particular Eurostat.
